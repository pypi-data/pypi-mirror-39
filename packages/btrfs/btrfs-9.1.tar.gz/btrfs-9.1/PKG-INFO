Description: python-btrfs
        ============
        
        Python 3 module to inspect btrfs filesystems.

        Btrfs is a copy on write (COW) filesystem for Linux aimed at implementing
        advanced features while focusing on fault tolerance, repair and easy
        administration.
        
        Project Goal
        ------------
        
        Currently, the primary goal of this module is  to be able to inspect the
        internals of an existing filesystem for educational purposes.
        
        A second goal is to provide a nicer way for automating administration tasks and
        writing monitoring scripts by being able to just programmatically access the
        needed information, instead of having to spend most of the time on parsing
        human readable output from other btrfs tools.
        
        The python module acts as a wrapper around the low level kernel calls and btrfs
        data structures, presenting them as python objects with interesting attributes
        and references to other objects.
        
        Development progress
        --------------------
        
        The module currently gained a quite good coverage of the kernel API and
        metadata structures to be useful for many introspection tasks. Documentation in
        tutorial form is still lacking, but the git commit history has a wealth of
        documentation on all parts of the code.
