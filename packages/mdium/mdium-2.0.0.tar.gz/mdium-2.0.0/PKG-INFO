        > publish your markdown to Medium, from the CLI
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```console
        $ pip install mdium
        ```
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Initializing
        
        First off, set up `mdium` with your Medium integration token. You’ll have to generate one from the [settings](https://medium.com/me/settings) page.
        ```console
        $ mdium init <integration-token>
        ```
        
        This will create a file at `~/.mdium`, containing your integration token and author ID.
        
        ### Publishing
        
        For publishing, your markdown doc must have the following frontmatter:
        
        ```yaml
        ---
        title: My Awesome Post
        tags: ['some', 'tags', 'here']
        status: draft
        ---
        
        ## markdown here
        ...
        ```
        
        Note that the `status` field can be either `draft` or `public`.
        
        Finally, run
        
        ```console
        $ mdium publish path/to/markdown.md
        Done! Your post has been published at https://medium.com/@gaben/76272e9d241c
        ```
        
        It’s that simple.
