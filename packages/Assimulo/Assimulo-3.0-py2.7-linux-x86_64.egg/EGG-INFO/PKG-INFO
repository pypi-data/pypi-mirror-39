Description: 
        Assimulo is a Cython / Python based simulation package that allows for 
        simulation of both ordinary differential equations (ODEs), f(t,y), and 
        differential algebraic equations (DAEs), f(t,y,yd). It combines a 
        variety of different solvers written in C, FORTRAN and Python via a 
        common high-level interface.
        
        Assimulo supports Explicit Euler, adaptive Runge-Kutta of 
        order 4 and Runge-Kutta of order 4. It also wraps the popular SUNDIALS 
        (https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html) solvers CVode 
        (for ODEs) and IDA (for DAEs). Ernst Hairer's 
        (http://www.unige.ch/~hairer/software.html) codes Radau5, Rodas and 
        Dopri5 are also available. For the full list, see the documentation.
        
        Documentation and installation instructions can be found at:

        The package requires Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib and additionally for 
        compiling from source, Cython 0.18, Sundials 2.6/2.7/3.1, BLAS and LAPACK 
        together with a C-compiler and a FORTRAN-compiler.
