        ## Overview
        
        While it is possible to build a web-crawler using a local python installation, we have a build process that runs on a local environment.  This simplifies initial set up and provides for a very consistent build and test environment.
        
        ## Key scripts
        
        The following scripts are found in the `build/` directory. Note that all scripts must be run from the Web-Crawler root directory.
