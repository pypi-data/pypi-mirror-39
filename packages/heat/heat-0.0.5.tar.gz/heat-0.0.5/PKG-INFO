Description: HeAT - Helmholtz Analytics Toolkit
        ==================================
        
        ![HeAT Logo](doc/images/logo_HeAT.png)
        
        HeAT is a distributed tensor framework for high performance data analytics.

        Goals
        -----
        
        The goal of HeAT is to fill the gap between machine learning libraries that have
        a strong focus on exploiting GPUs for performance, and traditional, distributed
        high-performance computing (HPC). The basic idea is to provide a generic,
        distributed tensor library with machine learning methods based on it.
        
        Among other things, the implementation will allow us to tackle use cases that
        would otherwise exceed memory limits of a single node.
        
        Features
        --------
        
          * high-performance n-dimensional tensors
          * CPU, GPU and distributed computation using MPI
          * powerful machine learning methods using above mentioned tensors
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        HeAT is based on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). Specifially, we are exploiting
        PyTorch's support for GPUs *and* MPI parallelism. Therefore, PyTorch must be
        compiled with MPI support when using HeAT. The instructions to install PyTorch
        in that way are contained in the script
        [install-torch.sh](install-torch.sh),
        which we're also using to install PyTorch in Travis CI.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Tagged releases are made available on the
        [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/heat/). You can typically
        install the latest version with
        
        > $ pip install heat
        
        If you want to work with the development version, you can checkout the sources using
        
        > $ git clone https://github.com/helmholtz-analytics/heat.git
