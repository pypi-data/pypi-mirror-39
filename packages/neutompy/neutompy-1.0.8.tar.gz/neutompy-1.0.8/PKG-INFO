        **NeuTomPy toolbox** is a Python package for tomographic data processing and reconstruction.
        Such toolbox includes pre-processing algorithms, artifacts removal and a wide range of iterative
        reconstruction methods as well as the Filtered Back Projection algorithm.
        The NeuTomPy toolbox was conceived primarily for Neutron Tomography and developed to support
        the need of users and researchers to compare state-of-the-art reconstruction methods and choose the optimal data-processing workflow for their data.
        
        # Features
        * Readers and writers for TIFF and FITS files and stack of images
        * Data normalization with dose correction, correction of the rotation axis tilt, ring-filters, outlier removals
        * A wide range of reconstruction algorithms powered by [ASTRA toolbox](https://www.astra-toolbox.com/): FBP, SIRT, SART, ART, CGLS, NN-FBP, MR-FBP
        * Image quality assessment with several metrics
        
        # Installation
        
        NeuTomPy toolbox supports **Linux** and **Windows** 64-bit operating system.
        
        First of all, install a [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) python environment with  **Python 3.5 or 3.6**.
        
        It is required to install some dependencies, hence run the following inside a conda environment:
        ```  console
        $ conda install -c simpleitk simpleitk
        $ conda install -c astra-toolbox astra-toolbox
        $ conda install -c conda-forge numexpr matplotlib astropy tifffile opencv scikit-image read-roi tqdm pywavelets
        ```
        
        Then install NeuTomPy toolbox via `pip`:
        
        ``` console
        $ pip install neutompy
        ```
        # Update
        
        To update a NeuTomPy installation to the latest version run:
        ``` console
        $ pip install neutompy --upgrade
        ```
        
        # Documentation
        Complete documentation can be found on Read the Docs: <https://neutompy-toolbox.readthedocs.io>.
        
        Tutorials and code examples of typical usage can be found in the folder [examples](https://github.com/dmici/NeuTomPy-toolbox/blob/master/examples).
        
        A sample dataset for testing purpose can be found [here](https://mega.nz/#F!k0g32QiC!zbGZMuTES4WOzrxJEfPaSA). This dataset includes neutron radiographs of a phantom sample acquired at the IMAT beamline, ISIS neutron spallation source, UK.
