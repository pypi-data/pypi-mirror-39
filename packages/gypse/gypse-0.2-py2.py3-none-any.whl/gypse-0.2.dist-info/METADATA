What is Gypse?
--------------

Have you ever tried looking for interesting things like URLs, E-Mails or Phone numbers in a bunch of text files? 
That is going to get really tough, really fast. It can be downright painful. 

Gypse is here to help. You simply install 'gypsy' with 'pip', and have Gypse look at your text files.
