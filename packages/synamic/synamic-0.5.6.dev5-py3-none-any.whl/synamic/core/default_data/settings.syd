# url_partition_comp (used for pagination, marks, etc.) -> pagination separator for both dir & url
# the path component after the url special sep determines what type of thing it is. e.g. for pagination it can be 'page'
# putting this after an url it will be determined whether the requested url is a pagination url
# One more thing, by default it is _ and it can be changed. BUT, urls cannot start with _ to protect this convention

url_partition_comp: _
# ...so pagination would be .../_/page/<a number>
