        <p>A a dataset in DCAT is defined as a "collection of data, published or 
        curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or 
        more formats". A dataset does not have to be available as a downloadable 
        file.
        For example, a dataset that is available via an API can be defined as an 
        instance of dcat:Dataset and the API can be defined as an instance of
        <tt>dcat:Distribution</tt>. DCAT itself does not define properties specific
        to APIs description. These are considered out of the scope of this version
        of the vocabulary. Nevertheless, this can be defined as a profile of the
        DCAT vocabulary.
