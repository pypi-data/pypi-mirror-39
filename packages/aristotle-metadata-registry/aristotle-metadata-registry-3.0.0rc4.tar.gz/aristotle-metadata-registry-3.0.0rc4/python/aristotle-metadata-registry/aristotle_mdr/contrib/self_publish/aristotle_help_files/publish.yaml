        <p>
        In some cases you can publish metadata you have made without
        submitting it for registration or endorsement. This is useful for information
        that may not be ready for standardisation, but is ready for sharing.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you are the original author of metadata, on the item page you will
        see a "Publish" option in the the top right action bar.
        Clicking this will give you options on when and how to publish metadata.
        </p>
        <p>
            When publishing, the following visibility options are available:
            <ul>
                <li>Public - allow anyone with permission to access the registry view this metadata.</li>
                <li>Active users - allow logged in users of the registry view the metadata</li>
                <li>Unpublish - remove the publication of the item to disallow access. This metadata may still be made visible via submitting for review.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        It is important to note that the purpose of a metadata registry is
        to expose 'standard' information that is endorsed for specific use.
        As such, it is advised that publication of metadata should be done 
        through the endorsement process by submitting it for review.
