Description: # Hashstate
        
        This is a Python C extension module that forks the ``hashlib`` implementation
        from CPython itself to add support for a single feature: the ability to
        serialize and deserialize hash objects so that the hash objects do not have
        to persist in memory for the whole duration of the hash computation.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```bash
        pip install hashstate
        ```
        
        ```python
        import hashstate
        
        # Contains all the same constructors as hashlib
        hash1 = hashstate.sha512()
        hash1.update('...')
        s = hash1.serialize()  # gives back bytes object
        
        hash2 = hashstate.sha512()
        hash2.deserialize(s)
        assert hash1.digest() == hash2.digest()
        ```
        
        ## Developers
        
        Build the package (requires openssl on your build paths):
        
            python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        
        If building a MacOS wheel, also run:
        
            delocate-wheel -v ./dist/*-macosx_*.whl
        
        Build the linux bdist_wheels (64-bit only at the moment):
        
            docker build -t manylinux-hashstate .
            docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/dist:/dist manylinux-hashstate
        
        Upload to pypi
        
            twine upload dist/*
