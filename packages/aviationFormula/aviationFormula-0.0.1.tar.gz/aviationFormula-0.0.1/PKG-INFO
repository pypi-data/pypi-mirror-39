Description: # aviationFormula
        A collection of formula around aviation and the globe in python.
        
        A documentation of the implemented formula will follow.
        
        # Requirements
        All formula should work with every version of python. Only basic modules (like `math`) are imported. For the future I want to avoid using 3rd party packages such as `numpy`.
        
        # Credits
        None of the formula in this package where derived or invented by me. The only thing I did was an implementation in python.
        
        The raw formula (and an implementation in VBA) are published by Ed Williams and can be found under the name [Aviation Formulary V1.46](http://www.edwilliams.org/avform.htm).
