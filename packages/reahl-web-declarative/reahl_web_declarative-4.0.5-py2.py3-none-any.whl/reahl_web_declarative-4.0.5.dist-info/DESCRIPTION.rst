Reahl is a web application framework that allows a Python programmer to work in terms of useful abstractions - using a single programming language.

Some core elements of Reahl can be implemented for use with different persistence technologies. This is such an implementation based on SqlAlchemy/Elixir.

See http://www.reahl.org/docs/4.0/tutorial/gettingstarted-install.d.html for installation instructions.
