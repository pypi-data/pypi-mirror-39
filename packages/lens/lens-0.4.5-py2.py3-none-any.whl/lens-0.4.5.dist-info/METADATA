lens
====

``lens`` is a library for exploring data in Pandas DataFrames. It computes
single column summary statistics and estimates the correlation between columns.
We wrote ``lens`` when we realised that the initial steps of acquiring a new
data set were almost formulaic: What data type is in this column? How many null
values are there? Which columns are correlated? What's the distribution of this
value? ``lens`` calculates all this for you.

See the documentation_ for more details.
