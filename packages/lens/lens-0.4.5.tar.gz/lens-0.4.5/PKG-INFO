Description: lens
        ====
        
        ``lens`` is a library for exploring data in Pandas DataFrames. It computes
        single column summary statistics and estimates the correlation between columns.
        We wrote ``lens`` when we realised that the initial steps of acquiring a new
        data set were almost formulaic: What data type is in this column? How many null
        values are there? Which columns are correlated? What's the distribution of this
        value? ``lens`` calculates all this for you.
        
        See the documentation_ for more details.
