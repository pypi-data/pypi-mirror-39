===========================
Stock Picking Delivery Rate
===========================

This module adds the concept of delivery rate quotes & purchasing
on Stock Pickings

This is meant to be combined with an external connector with a carrier
supplier in order to bring in rate quotes, although they can be created &
edited manually if your workflow calls for it.

Usage
=====

Dispatch rates can be added in Stock Picking

Purchase Rate
-------------

The Purchase Rate wizard can be accessed by clicking the green check next
to the rate quote in a ``stock.picking``.

Completing this wizard will create ``purchase.order`` for your rate.
If using a connector, this is the point in which a shipment purchase would
be triggered.
