**<span style="color:#009EE3">OpenSignals Tools</span>** is set of documents and a **<span class="color1">Python</span>** library to provide programming examples in the form of **<span class="color5">Jupyter Notebooks</span>**, as companion to the **<span style="color:#009EE3">OpenSignals</span>** biosignals acquisition tools.

This collection of code samples has the purpose to help users of PLUX Wireless Biosignals systems, such as **bitalino** or **biosignalsplux**, and to the researcher or student interested on recording processing and classifying biosignals. The examples are set on a level of complexity to inspire the users and programmers on how easy some tasks are and that more complex ones can also be achieved, by reusing and recreating some of the examples presented here.

A **<span class="color1">Python</span>** library (entitled **<span style="color:#009EE3">opensignalsfactory</span>** ) is the base toolbox to support the notebooks and to provide some useful functionalities. It can be installed through pip command, like demonstrated in a [PyPI <img src="../../images/icons/link.png" width="10px" height="10px" style="display:inline">](https://pypi.org/project/opensignalsfactory/) dedicated page.

In many cases we also point and illustrate with code the usage of other python toolboxes dedicated to biosignal processing.

The notebooks will cover the full topics pipeline of working with biosignals: **<span class="color1">Open</span>** a file; **<span class="color3">Visualise</span>** the data online and offline, **<span class="color4">Process</span>** a one channel signal or a multi-channel acquisition, **<span class="color5">Detect</span>** relevant events in the signals, **<span class="color6">Extract</span>** features from many different type of sensors and domains, **<span class="color7">Decide</span>** among a set of classes with several machine learning approaches, **<span class="color8">Explain</span>** the obtained results with metrics and validations techniques.

These examples are carried in a multitude of biosignals , from ECG, EDA, EMG, Accelerometer, Respiration among many others.
The notebooks have a set of labels to help navigate among topics <...>, types of signals <...>, application area <...> and complexity <...> level to support the search for particular solutions.

We encourage you to share new example ideas, to pose questions :::ADD email here:::, and to make improvements or suggestion to this set of notebooks.

**Be inspired on how to make the most of your biosignals!**
