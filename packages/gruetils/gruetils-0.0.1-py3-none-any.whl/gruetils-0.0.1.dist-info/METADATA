# Gruetils

This is a simple collection of small utilities shared amongst many of my personal projects.

Contents include:
* gruetils.collections.KeyedDefaultDict - a [`defaultdict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict) that passes the attempted key as the first and only argument to its `default_factory` method
