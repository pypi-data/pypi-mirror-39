# Type-safe Monads

This is an experiment in building monads in Python supported by strict
type annotations. The goal is to be able to compose monads with the
type checker ensuring their correctness.


## Motivation

I'm a fan of monads, but believe they work best with the support of a
strong type system. I've attempted to use libraries like
[PyMonad](https://pypi.org/project/PyMonad/), but been frustrated by a
lack of type constraints preventing incorrect usage. I could've
attempted to add type annotations to one of those libraries, but
building my own is more fun.
