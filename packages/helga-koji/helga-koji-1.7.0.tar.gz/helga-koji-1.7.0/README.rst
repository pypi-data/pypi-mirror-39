About
-----

Helga is a Python chat bot. Full documentation can be found at
http://helga.readthedocs.org.

This Koji plugin allows Helga to respond to koji-related commands in IRC
and print information about builds and tasks.

Estimate when the current (ongoing) build will complete::

  03:14 < ktdreyer> helgabot: current ceph build
  03:14 < helgabot> ktdreyer, ceph-12.2.1-1.el7cp should finish building in
                    3 min 45 sec
                    https://cbs.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=20348

Find out how long the most recent completed build took to finish::

  03:14 < ktdreyer> helgabot: last ceph build
  03:14 < helgabot> ktdreyer, ceph-12.2.2-0.el7 build duration was 2 hr 49 min
                    https://cbs.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=21149

Query for packages::

  03:14 < ktdreyer> helgabot: ceph package
  03:14 < helgabot> ktdreyer, ceph is
                    https://cbs.centos.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=534

Find a user's tasks::

  03:14 < ktdreyer> helgabot: soandso's tasks
  03:14 < helgabot> ktdreyer, soandso's kernel scratch build should be done in
                    1 hr 26 min
                    (https://koji.example.com/koji/taskinfo?taskID=15741633)

Estimating tasks by URL::

  < ktdreyer> helgabot: https://koji.example.com/koji/taskinfo?taskID=12456
  < helgabot> ktdreyer, that kernel scratch build should be done in 1 hr 26
              min.

Installation
------------
This Koji plugin is `available from PyPI
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/helga-koji>`_, so you can simply install
it with ``pip``::

  pip install helga-koji

If you want to hack on the helga-koji source code, in your virtualenv
where you are running Helga, clone a copy of this repository from GitHub and
run
``python setup.py develop``.

Configuration
-------------

helga-koji uses the `txkoji <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txkoji>`_ library,
which looks for configuration files at ``~/.koji/config.d/*.conf`` and
``/etc/koji.conf.d/*.conf``. To configure helga-koji for your Koji instance,
you must have configuration file(s) in this location on disk. This is how the
normal `koji client <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/koji>`_ works.

TODO
----

Watching tasks::

  < ktdreyer> helgabot: watch
              https://koji.example.com/koji/taskinfo?taskID=12456
  < helgabot> ktdreyer, that kernel scratch build should be done in 1 hr 26
              min. I'll tell you when it's done.

Or watch on behalf of someone else::

  < ktdreyer> helgabot: watch
              https://koji.example.com/koji/taskinfo?taskID=12456 for adeza
  < helgabot> ktdreyer, that kernel scratch build should be done in 1 hr 26
              min. I'll tell that person when it's done.
