        of parameters, the Lipschitz constant, the L_2 norm of the weights, or
        learning rate at materialization time.
      metrics: Dict of metric results keyed by name. The values of the dict are
        the results of calling a metric function, namely a `(metric_tensor,

        impact on state (typically is a pure computation results based on
        variables.). For example, it should not trigger the `update_op` or
        requires any input fetching. This is meant to contain metrics of
        interest, such as the training loss, complexity regularized loss, or
        standard deviation of the last layer outputs.
