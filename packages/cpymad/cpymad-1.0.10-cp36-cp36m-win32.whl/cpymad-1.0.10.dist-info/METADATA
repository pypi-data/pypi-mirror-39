cpymad
------
|Version| |License| |Python| |Tests| |Coverage|

cpymad is a Cython_ binding to MAD-X_ for giving full control and access to a
MAD-X interpreter within the python environment.

This version of cpymad should be built against MAD-X |VERSION|. It can be
installed on linux, Windows and Mac (but I can't offer much help for Mac).
Python 3 is recommended but not (yet) required.

License
~~~~~~~

The cpymad source code itself is under free license.

However, the MAD-X software package and henceforth all binary cpymad package
distributions are **NOT FREE**.

Reporting issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

cpymad is NOT maintained by CERN members and links against an unofficial build
of MAD-X that is not supported by CERN, i.e. this binary may have problems
that the official binary does not have and vice versa.

If you have a problem with a sequence file, first try to check if that
problem remains when using the MAD-X command line client distributed by
CERN, then:

- Report the issue to CERN only if it **can** be reproduced with their
  official command line client.
- Report the issue here only if it can **not** be reproduced with their
  official command line client.

For issues regarding the cpymad code itself or usage information, I'm happy to
answer. Please keep it *precise*, *specific*, and *concise* and provide all
the necessary information.

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

1.0.10
======
Date: 07.12.2018

- fix broken caching logic in travis config
- move type constants to ``cpymad.types``
- export a MAD-X dtype to python type mapping from ``cpymad.types``


1.0.9
=====
Date: 21.11.2018

- suppress internal stack traces
- raise exception for failed twiss instead of returning invalid table that
  will crash later on
- fix incorrect ``Element.position`` attribute for sequences with
  ``refer=entry`` or ``refer=exit``
- allow passing parameters with underscore suffix to commands, this allows
  passing parameters as bare words that conflict with python keywords (e.g.
  ``madx.command.select(class_='quadrupole')``
- improve ``repr()`` for ``Table``: show column names


1.0.8
=====
Date: 18.10.2018

- add ``Table.dframe()`` method to return pandas dataframe (provisional API)
- return success status from ``Madx.input`` (MAD-X errorflag)
- update install instructions to account for symbol visibility
- fix MAD-X crash on errors due to interposition of ``error`` by libc (linux)
- automatically update documentation from travis
- add ``quit`` method to shutdown the interpreter and wait for the process
- fix file deletion in case of errors within ``temp_filename`` context
- make ``Madx`` usable as context manager
- use the correct line continuation in .bat example
- fix manylinux build error: not creating libmadx.c
- fix "Permission denied" error when having to clone MAD-X etc
- fix incorrect ABI in the -cp27mu- wheel
- allow specifying MAD-X/cpymad source tarballs for manylinux build
- rework usage of data volumes in manylinux container: readonly cpymad folder
- automatically build and upload manylinux releases from travis!
- fix rare race-condition in stream reader -> delayed output
- replace some magic numbers with human readable names
- use ``coverage combine`` instead of custom path hack before uploading
  coverage data
- move cpymad package to unimportable subdirectory
