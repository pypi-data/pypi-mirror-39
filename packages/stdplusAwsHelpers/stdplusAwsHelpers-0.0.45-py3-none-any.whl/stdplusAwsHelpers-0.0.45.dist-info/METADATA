python-stdplus-awsHelpers: a set of utility functions for python boto3
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Overview
========

stdplus is just a collection of python functions I've found useful to
have on hand. The stdplus-awsHelpers collection is exactly what you'd
expect given its name: a collection of python functions for dealing
with AWS stuff.

WARNINGS
========

This library is incredibly immature. It WILL be changing considerably as
long as I'm using it, because I will be viewing the things it does (or
doesn't do), and the manner in which it does (or doesn't do) them as
impediments to my workflow.

With that said, I tend to write stdplus functions using the smallest
possible components I can, so those individual functions tend to
be fairly stable. I'll endeavor not to make backwards-incompatible
changes, because that will shoot *me* in the foot.
