PyEmir MOS Tutorial
###################

This tutorial provides a short introduction to the rectification and wavelength
calibration of EMIR spectroscopic images using PyEmir. In any case, it is
expected to be an easy introduction to the use of numina and PyEmir. 

For detailed documentation concerning the installation of PyEmir, see the
:ref:`user`.

.. warning::

   This "MOS Tutorial" is still a work in progress; several aspects of PyEmir
   are not yet covered sufficient detail. More detailed instructions will be
   provided here in the future.

As shown in the previous diagram, PyEmir helps to generate a rectified and
wavelength calibrated 2D image. From this point, the astronomer can use her
favourite software tools to proceed with the spectra extraction and analysis.
