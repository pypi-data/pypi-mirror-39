Description: # BioSamples v4 Python Library
        
        This is a small library which aims to provide a Python client
        to access BioSamples v4 new API.
        
        The client is still under heavy development, so any contribution is very
        well welcomed.
        
        ## Local Development
        This project uses [pipenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pipenv) to handle
        both the virtual environment and the dependencies.
        Follow the instructions available on pipenv site to see how to install it.
        
        Once you have pipenv installed on you machine, just type
        ```bash
        pipenv install
        ```
