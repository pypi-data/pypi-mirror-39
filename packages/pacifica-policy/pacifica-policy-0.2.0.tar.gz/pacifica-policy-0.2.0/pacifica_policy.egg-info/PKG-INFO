        This is the Pacifica Policy API and implements policy decisions
        for the rest of the Pacifica software.
        
        ## Installing the Service
        
        ### Use the docker container
        
        ```
        docker pull pacifica/policy
        ```
        
        ### The Docker Compose Way
        
        Build the images from `pacifica-metadata`.
        ```
        docker-compose build
        ```
        
        Bring up the policy and metadata images.
        ```
        docker-compose up
        ```
        
        ### The Manual Way
        
        Install the dependencies using pip (or some other similar python way).
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        Run the code.
        ```
        python PolicyServer.py
        ```
        
        ## The API
        
        The policy server is split up into endpoints named for their Pacifica
        project that utilizes them. So the path `/uploader` is used by the
        Pacifica Uploader (http://github.com/pacifica/pacifica-uploader) to
        control its behavior. The idea is that workflow implemented by the
        various Pacifica projects has some element of site or instance
        specific policy that can be applied to the running service. The policy
        is driven by the metadata and thus this project should talk to the
        metadata service.
