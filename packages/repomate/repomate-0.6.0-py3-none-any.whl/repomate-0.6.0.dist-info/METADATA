## Overview
`repomate` is A CLI tool for administrating large amounts of GitHub
repositories, geared towards teachers and GitHub Enterprise. `repomate` is
currently being used for the introductory courses in computer science at
[KTH Royal Technical Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en/eecs). The
courses have roughly 200 students and several thousands of repositories,
allowing us to test `repomate` at quite a large scale.

### Getting started
The best way to get started with `repomate` is to head over to the
[Docs](https://repomate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), where you (among other
things) will find the
[install instructions](https://repomate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
and
[user guide](https://repomate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide.html).


## Why `repomate`?
`repomate` was developed at KTH Royal Technical Institute of Technology to help
teachers and teaching assistants administrate GitHub repositories. It is
inspired by the old
[`teachers_pet` tool](https://github.com/education/teachers_pet), with added
features and a user experience more to our liking. Features range from creating
student repositories based on master (template) repos, to opening and closing
issues in bulk, to assigning peer reviews and cloning repos in bulk. Some parts
of `repomate` can be customized using a simple but powerful [plugin
system](https://github.com/slarse/repomate-plug). For example, the
[`repomate-junit4` plugin](https://github.com/slarse/repomate-junit4) allows for
automatically running `JUnit4` test classes on production code in student repos.
Below is the output from running `repomate -h`, giving brief descriptions of
each of the main featues:

```
$ repomate -h
usage: repomate [-h] [-v]
                {show-config,setup,update,migrate,clone,add-to-teams,
                 open-issues,close-issues,list-issues,assign-peer-reviews,
                 purge-peer-review-teams,check-peer-review-progress,
                 verify-settings}
                ...

                        Fetch all peer review teams for the specified student
                        repos, and check which assigned reviews have been done
                        (i.e. which issues have been opened).

  -v, --version         Display version info
```

## Roadmap
`repomate` is currently in public beta. The currently existing commands are
fairly stable and are unlikely to change, barring unexpected bugs or usability
issues. This is with the exception of the peer review commands, that are under
active development.

**The internal API of `repomate`, including the plugin system, is less stable and
may or may not change significantly in the near future.**

Any breaking changes will be advertised with deprecation messages in the
application well before they are put in effect. `repomate` is expected to
reach 1.0 before December 14th.
