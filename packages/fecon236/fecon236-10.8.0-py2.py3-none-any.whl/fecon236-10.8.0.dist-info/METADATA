## fecon236 :: Tools for financial economics

***Curated wrapper over Python ecosystem.
Source code for fecon235 Jupyter notebooks.***

GitHub repository is at [fecon236], see [CHANGELOG][236log] for revision history.
The protected **master** branch gets released via `pip`, see our [PyPI].
The **develop** branch is where pull requests are currently directed.

### What is this repository for?

**fecon236** provides an interface for ***financial economics*** to the Python
ecosystem, especially packages for mathematics, statistics, science,
engineering, and data analysis.
Complex packages such as *numpy, pandas, statsmodels, scipy, and matplotlib*
are seamlessly integrated at a high-level with APIs of various data hosts for:

- Essential commands which correctly handle annoying low-level pitfalls.

- Retrieval of economic and financial data, both historical and the most current. 

- Data munging, for example, resampling and alignment of time-series data
  from hosts using mutually incompatible formats.

- Analysis using techniques from econometrics, time-series analysis,
  and statistical machine learning.

- Abstraction and software optimization of mathematical operators,
  for example, linear algebra used in portfolio analysis.

- Visualization of data using graphical packages. 

- *Reproducible research which is collaborative and openly accessible
  at zero cost.*

To practically test theoretical ideas interactively,
[fecon236] can employed with any Python IDE interactive development
environment, IPython console, or with a Jupyter notebook.
The code has been tested against both python27 and python3 since 2014,
and works across major platforms: Linux, Mac, and Windows.

***The best way to see the convenience of [fecon236] in action is to
run the notebooks in the fecon235 `nb` [directory][235nb].***


### How does one get started?

For installation details and FAQ, please first visit our [wiki].
For the casual user in an [Anaconda] environment, we recommend:
`conda update pip`, then `pip install --pre fecon236`

Documentation is currently being served from [236docs].
Please start your orientation with this [README notebook][readnb]
which shows how most of this project is self-documenting.


### Development status: stable

For the developer, we recommend forking the [fecon236] repository, then
`pip install --editable .`

- fecon235 becomes a repository *solely* of Jupyter notebooks.
  The old Python source code at [fecon235] will remain for archival purposes,
  while *new* code development shifts over to [fecon236].

Version 10 of fecon236 represents refactoring of the fecon235 v5.18.0312
Python code, not the Jupyter notebooks, with a *new* architecture
depicted in Appendix 1. Function names have been retained, but under fecon236
expect infrequent function calls to be explicit rather than implicit,
i.e. modules names and their aliases are significant.

- After 2019-01-01, our official support for python27 will discontinue
  (like numpy and pandas), however, straddling code may still
  continue to work.

Version 11 of fecon236 will signal when our [Travis] builds under Python 2.7
fail, and at that point we expect to require at least Python 3.6.
