Description: # filepursuit
        
        A python tool for scraping and downloading files from filepursuer
        
        ## Usage
        Invoke the script as follows:
        
            filepursuit -s "SEARCH TERMS" -o "OUTPUT PATH" -t "TYPE"
        
        where:
        
        * SEARCH TERMS: Is a list of search terms between " "
        * OUTPUT PATH: Is the path of the directory where you want to save the
        downloaded files
        * TYPE: Is the type of files you can search for (all, video, audio,
        ebook, archive, mobile or a custom extension)
        
        
        ## TODO
        
        * Change the scripts names: *scraper* also downloads the file, it doesnt
        just scrape the site.
        * Maybe add support for more direct download sites
        * Improve the "interface".
