        Donations
        ---------
        
        I work on this project in my spare time, as most free software developers
        do. And of course, I enjoy this work a lot. There is no and will never be
        a need to pay anything for using this software.
        
        However, if you want to donate me a cup of coffee, a beer in the evening,
        my monthly hosting fees or anything else embellishing my day a little
        more, that would be awesome. If you decide doing so, I want to thank you
        very much! But please be assured that I'm not presuming anybody to donate,
        it's entirely your choice.
