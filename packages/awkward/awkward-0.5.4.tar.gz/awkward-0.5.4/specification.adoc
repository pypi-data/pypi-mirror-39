== Introduction

Array programming is a general programming paradigm, similar to functional programming or object-oriented programming in its scope. Pioneered by APL in 1962, this paradigm has appeared primarily in interactive data processing languages aimed at data analysts and statisticians: S (1976), MATLAB (1984), S-PLUS (1988), R (1993), and Numpy (2005). Numpy, unlike its predecessors, is not a language in itself, but a foundational library for science and statistics in Python.

Array programming is mostly used to solve problems with regular, rectangular grids. It is possible to represent and operate on more complex data structures, but it is awkward to do so in current frameworks. Fortunately, this awkwardness may be hidden in a suite of higher-level array classes that present modest extensions of the array programming paradigm to the user.

https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-array[awkward-array] (https://pypi.org/project/awkward[awkward] on PyPI) is an implementation of complex data structures and operations in Python, depending only on https://pandas.pydata.org[Numpy]. Drop-in replacements optimized with compiled code or leveraging GPUs are foreseen, though they would present the same user interface as the Numpy-only implementation. Extensions for using awkward-array as https://pandas.pydata.org[Pandas] columns, in https://pandas.pydata.org[Numba]-compiled functions, and in distributed calculations with https://pandas.pydata.org[Dask] are also foreseen. These arrays can already be used to view https://arrow.apache.org[Arrow] data and can be persisted and reconstituted in any data format supporting Numpy arrays, such as HDF5, or named binary blobs, such as ZIP or key-value stores.

=== This specification

Despite awkward-array's focus on Python and Numpy, the data model it represents is language-agnostic. This document describes awkward-array as a protocol for generalizing array programming to complex structures in any environment. It is a normative document in the sense that it describes what awkward-array in Python _should_ do; discrepancies between this document and the Python implementation would usually be decided in favor of the document (though the document itself may have "`bugs`" to be fixed in a later version). It is also normative in the sense that other implementations, in C++ or MATLAB for instance, that claim to "`adhere to the awkward-array specification`" _should_ also behave as described here.

The goal of this document is to describe an array programming interface that extends a basic array programming interface. The extended interface is called "`awkward-array`" and the basic interface is a well-known starting point, such as Numpy. For simplicity, we will use Python syntax and Numpy function names, but a library in a different language or based on a different array library may still adhere to the awkward-array specification by providing a translation of these idioms.

It is not a goal of this document to explain how the awkward-array features are implemented. Drop-in replacements for the Numpy-only awkward-array library and libraries in other environments are free to implement the specification differently. They will thus have different performance characteristics. This specification cannot provide any performance hints.

Documentation is not an explicit goal of this specification, though users may read it to learn how to use any compliant implementation. Unlike documentation, however, this document describes what an awkward-array library should do, not necessarily what it does. Users are encouraged to file https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-array/issues[issues here] if a discrepancy is found in the Numpy-only implementation.

The major and minor version numbers of this specification, `xx.yy`, correspond to the major and minor version numbers of the Numpy-only implementation: `xx.yy` in `xx.yy.zz`. The revision number, `zz`, increases as the implementation strives toward compliance with the specification. This particular version of the specification is a pre-release; compliance is only required for released specifications.

A library may implement more features than those described in this specification without affecting its compliance. If it implements fewer classes or fewer methods, it can only be said to be "`partially compliant,`" and would have to enumerate the missing classes or methods.

=== Basic array protocol

Necessary features of the underlying array library are described in this section for two reasons: to establish a syntax used in the rest of this document and as a basis for translating idioms of non-Numpy libraries into the language of this document. For instance, another language may use a function to extract slices of an array, rather than Python's `array[start:stop:step]` syntax. If so, the awkward-array idiom in that language would use the same function name and arguments, rather than the Python ones.

The underlying array library must have the following features or some translation thereof.

It must be possible to represent ordered sequences of primitive values, known as *arrays*. An array is homogeneous: all values in an array have the same *dtype*, or primitive data type. Primitive types include integers, floating point numbers, and boolean (true/false) values. An awkward-array library inherits the primitives of the underlying library -- if a base array library doesn't support complex numbers (for instance), then neither does its awkward-array extension. Arrays need not be fixed-size, contiguous in memory, with only fixed-bytesize primitives, but these are the simplest cases.

It must be possible to construct _N_-dimensional arrays for any positive integer _N_. We will refer to an array's size in all dimensions as its *shape*, a tuple of positive integers whose product is the total number of elements in the array. The *length* of an array is the array's size in its first dimension.

t must be possible to *extract* an array element by integer index or a tuple of _N_ integer indexes for an _N_-dimensional array. In this document, we will use 0-indexing: `0` extracts the first element, `1` extracts the second, etc. If an index is greater than or equal to _N_, it is out of bounds. An array library with 1-indexing (`1` extracts the first element) would correspondingly have 1-indexing in its awkward-array extensions. We will use a number between square brackets after the array, as in `myarray[5]`, or a comma-separated tuple like `myarray[3, 1, 4]`, to represent extraction.

The array library may provide a mechanism for counting from the end of an array dimension. In Python, `-1` refers to the last element, `-2` to the second-to-last element, etc. We will use that convention. Given a negative index `i` and a dimension size `d`, the standard index is `i + d`. If the standard index is still negative, the index is out of bounds.

It must be possible to *slice* an array dimension to get a subsequence of that array along any dimension. A slice is defined by a *start* index (lower bound element number), a *stop* index (upper bound element number), and an optional *step* (stride length, for skipping a regular number of input elements between each returned element). In this document, we will use inclusive start values (the lower bound is included in the resulting subsequence) and exclusive stop values (the upper bound is not included). A step of `1` is equivalent to no step, and the step must not be `0`, though negative values may be allowed (to reverse order). If either start or stop is not provided, they may be assumed to be `0` and the size of the dimension (respectively) if step is positive, or one less than the size of the dimension and one less than `0` (respectively) if step is negative. If the difference between step and start is not an integer multiple of step, we take that the subsequence to be truncated at the last element before stop. If either start or step are beyond the bounds of the array, we take them to be truncated to the nearest legal values, which may result in an empty subsequence, but not an error. If negative indexes are allowed for element extraction, they may be allowed for slicing as well. The Python syntax for this operation is `myarray[start:stop:step]` (in which any `start`, `stop`, or `step` may be missing or `None`, and the second colon may be omitted if there is no `step`). We will use this syntax in this document.

It must be possible to *mask* elements in an array dimension by a 1-dimensional boolean array of the same size as that array dimension. The result of such an operation is a sequence in the same order containing only the elements for which the matching boolean value is true. The Numpy syntax for this operation is to put the boolean `mymask` array in square brackets after the array: `myarray[mymask]`, but it may be a named function call.

It must be possible to *gather* elements in an array dimension by a 1-dimensional integer array, using the integer array as extraction indexes. The result of such an operation, denoted `myarray[myindexes]`, is a sequence with the same length and order as the indexing array `myindexes`, containing elements from `myarray`. The same rules apply to the elements of the indexing array as for single-element extraction. (In Numpy, this is sometimes called "`fancy indexing,`" though sometimes that term encompasses masking as well, so we will use "`gather`" in this document, as this is what the operation is called in SIMD programming.) As with masking, this may be a named function call.

It must either be possible to apply selections to multiple dimensions in a single call or to apply a selection to a specified dimension, not necessarily the first. For instance, we could extract from the first dimension, slice the second, mask the third, and gather the fourth in Numpy by separating requests with commas: `myarray[5, start:stop:step, mymask, myindexes]`. Selecting in multiple dimensions would allow selection in a specified dimension by passing all-inclusive slices to all dimensions before the dimension of interest: `myarray[:, :, :, selection]`. Selecting a specified dimension would allow selecting multiple dimensions by composition, so either is sufficient.

It must be possible to map arithmetic operations across all elements of one or more arrays. Any *kernel* function of _n_ primitive type arguments returning a primitive type result can be applied to _n_ equal-shape arrays and return a single new array of results with the same shape. The kernel function must be pure (no side effects), and many would be expressible as special syntax, such as `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, etc. In Numpy, these are called "`universal functions`" or "`ufuncs,`" but this is such a specific protocol that we use a more general word, *mapped kernels*.

If any arguments in a mapped kernel have a scalar primitive type, rather than an array, they should be replaced by a constant array of the correct shape before mapping the kernel. If an argument has the correct dimensionality but some of its dimensions have size `1` where the other arguments have a size greater than `1`, this dimension should be similarly expanded to a constant before mapping. These expansions do not need to be literal -- the result is calculated _as though_ the scalar or singleton dimension were a constant array. This conceptual expansion is known as *broadcasting* in Numpy and in this document.

It must be possible to reduce an array by a binary arithmetic operation along a given dimension. The array is reduced in dimension by one; 1-dimensional arrays are reduced to primitive scalars. Empty dimensions or arrays may be reduced to the operation's identity if the operation has an identity -- it must return an error otherwise. The identity for addition is `0`, multiplication is `1`, and we may take the identity for minimization and maximization to be the largest and smallest values available in the primitive data type, respectively. For instance, the minimum of an empty array of floating point numbers may be taken to be infinity.

Any array library supporting these basic features may be extended as specified in this document.

== Features provided by an awkward-array library

An awkward-array library provides the above features in the following new contexts.

   * *Jaggedness:* multidimensional arrays with a non-constant shape. A jagged array is an array of arbitrary-length lists.
   * *Product types:* extend a primitive type system with record structures -- objects with named, typed fields.
   * *Sum types:* extend a primitive type system with tagged unions -- values that may have one of a set of enumerated types. This permits arrays to be heterogeneous in a controlled way.
   * *Masking:* extend a primitive type system with a nullable type -- values that may be "`missing.`"
   * *Cross-references and cyclic references:* extend a primitive type system with values that may be references to another array, including a parent of the array in which they reside. This adds "`pointers`" to the type system in a controlled way: references must point to elements of a specified array.
   * *Object types:* allow array elements to virtually contain instances of any type expressible in a programming language, provided that it can be constructed strictly from elements of the array.
   * *Object methods:* adds user-defined methods to arrays, usually to emulate object methods as mapped kernels.
   * *Non-contiguousness:* allows arrays to be non-contiguous in memory by mapping indexes.
   * *Laziness:* allows arrays to be generated on demand.

Jaggedness, product types, sum types, masking, and references extend the expressivity of basic arrays to a complete, hierarchical data model. General data containers like https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers[Protocol buffers], https://thrift.apache.org[Thrift], https://avro.apache.org[Avro], and https://parquet.apache.org[Parquet] present this data model, with the exception of references.

Object types and methods generalize it further, allowing any type permitted by a programming language such as Python, with a loss of cross-language compatibility.

Non-contiguousness does not affect data type, but it virtually concatenates data from separate chunks into a single, logical array without copying.

Laziness does not affect data type, but it allows arrays that may be remote or not loaded into memory to be treated on the same footing as arrays that have.

Taken together, these features promote array programming to a wider set of applications.

=== High-level types

To describe how awkward-array extends basic array types, we start by defining a notation that encompasses both. Basic arrays can be fully described by their dtype and shape. These parameters are not sufficient for awkward-array.

==== Basic arrays

Any array, including those in awkward-array, can be thought of as a function that maps extraction indexes to values. The functional type of a basic, 1-dimensional array with value type `T` and length `n` could be written as

[source]
----
[0, n) -> T
----

That is, the array is a function that takes an integer greater than or equal to `0` and less than `n` as its only argument, and returns a value of type `T`. The possible value types are the primitive types of the basic array library. Knowing the array's type signature as an extraction function is enough to deduce its behavior in slicing, masking, and gathering.

A 2-dimensional array with shape `(n, m)` is a function that returns a function.

[source]
----
[0, n) -> [0, m) -> T
----

That is, if we pass an integer `[0, n)` to the 2-dimensional array, we get a 1-dimensional array; if we pass an integer `[0, m)` to that 1-dimensional array, we get a primitive value of type `T`. This https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying[currying] can be applied indefinitely to describe arrays of any dimensionality. The shape in a tuple syntax like Numpy's is more concise, but we will need the longer form.

==== Jagged arrays

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagged_array[Jagged arrays] are like multidimensional arrays in the number of integer arguments that must be passed before obtaining a scalar primitive type, but not all of the arguments have precise domains. A simple jagged array of length `n`, only one level of jaggedness, and primitive type `T` would be expressed as

[source]
----
[0, n) -> [0, inf) -> T
----

because the second argument may be any non-negative integer. Unlike a basic array, some values for this second parameter, allowed by the above expression, would be rejected in practice. For example, the array

[source, python]
----
[[1, 2, 3], [], [4, 5]]
----

would accept only `[0, 3)` as a second argument if the first argument is `0`, would accept nothing (empty domain) if the first argument is `1`, and would accept only `[0, 2)` if the first argument is `2`. We have a choice between expressing the type signature fully, such that any arguments satisfying that signature would never fail to return a primitive value, and underexpressing it with `[0, inf)`, which has the advantage that the length of the type signature does not scale with the length of the array itself. Brevity is more useful for our purposes.

Continuing this line of reasoning, a doubly jagged array, such as

[source, python]
----
[[[1, 2, 3], []], [[4, 5]], []]
----

would have type

[source]
----
[0, n) -> [0, inf) -> [0, inf) -> T
----

==== Product types

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_type[Product types] are variously known as "`records,`" "`structs,`" "`compounds,`" "`classes,`" etc. They are values that contain a fixed set of named, typed attributes. They are "`products`" in the sense of Cartesian products: the set of records containing a floating point `x` and an integer `i` is the Cartesian product of the set of floating point values and the set of integer values.

To extract an attribute from a record, we give the record the attribute's name. In a dynamically typed language, this amounts to passing a string argument; in a statically typed language, this string is usually a parsed, checked, compile-time literal. In either case, we can express it as an extraction function like

[source]
----
'x' -> float64
'i' -> int64
----

The names are enumerated because there is a fixed set of choices, and each choice returns a potentially different type. An array of length `n` containing these records is

[source]
----
[0, n) -> 'x' -> float64
          'i' -> int64
----

In general, the form is a sequence of name, type specification pairs called *fields* that can be embedded in a type specification. Product types with the same set of fields, in any order, are equivalent, though an awkward-array library should maintain the user-specified order for readability.
