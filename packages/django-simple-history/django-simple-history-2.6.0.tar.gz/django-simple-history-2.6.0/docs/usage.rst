Quick Start
===========

Install
-------

Install from `PyPI`_ with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install django-simple-history

.. _pypi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-simple-history/


Configure
---------

Settings
~~~~~~~~

Add ``simple_history`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        'simple_history',
    ]

The historical models can track who made each change. To populate the
history user automatically you can add middleware to your Django
settings:

.. code-block:: python

    MIDDLEWARE = [
        # ...
        'simple_history.middleware.HistoryRequestMiddleware',
    ]

If you do not want to use the middleware, you can explicitly indicate
the user making the change as documented in :doc:`/advanced`.

Models
~~~~~~

To track history for a model, create an instance of
``simple_history.models.HistoricalRecords`` on the model.

An example for tracking changes on the ``Poll`` and ``Choice`` models in the
Django tutorial:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models
    from simple_history.models import HistoricalRecords

    class Poll(models.Model):
        question = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')
        history = HistoricalRecords()

    class Choice(models.Model):
        poll = models.ForeignKey(Poll)
        choice_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)
        history = HistoricalRecords()

Now all changes to ``Poll`` and ``Choice`` model instances will be tracked in
the database.

Run Migrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With your model changes in place, create and apply the database migrations:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py makemigrations
    $ python manage.py migrate

Existing Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For existing projects, you can call the populate command to generate an
initial change for preexisting model instances:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py populate_history --auto

By default, history rows are inserted in batches of 200. This can be changed if needed for large tables
by using the ``--batchsize`` option, for example ``--batchsize 500``.

.. _admin_integration:

Integration with Django Admin
-----------------------------

To allow viewing previous model versions on the Django admin site, inherit from
the ``simple_history.admin.SimpleHistoryAdmin`` class when registering your
model with the admin site.

This will replace the history object page on the admin site and allow viewing
and reverting to previous model versions.  Changes made in admin change forms
will also accurately note the user who made the change.

.. image:: screens/1_poll_history.png

Clicking on an object presents the option to revert to that version of the object.

.. image:: screens/2_revert.png

(The object is reverted to the selected state)

.. image:: screens/3_poll_reverted.png

Reversions like this are added to the history.

.. image:: screens/4_history_after_poll_reverted.png

An example of admin integration for the ``Poll`` and ``Choice`` models:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.contrib import admin
    from simple_history.admin import SimpleHistoryAdmin
    from .models import Poll, Choice

    admin.site.register(Poll, SimpleHistoryAdmin)
    admin.site.register(Choice, SimpleHistoryAdmin)

Changing a history-tracked model from the admin interface will automatically record the user who made the change (see :doc:`/advanced`).


Displaying custom columns in the admin history list view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the history log displays one line per change containing

* a link to the detail of the object at that point in time
* the date and time the object was changed
* a comment corresponding to the change
* the author of the change

You can add other columns (for example the object's status to see
how it evolved) by adding a ``history_list_display`` array of fields to the
admin class

.. code-block:: python

    from django.contrib import admin
    from simple_history.admin import SimpleHistoryAdmin
    from .models import Poll, Choice


    class PollHistoryAdmin(SimpleHistoryAdmin):
        list_display = ["id", "name", "status"]
        history_list_display = ["status"]
        search_fields = ['name', 'user__username']

    admin.site.register(Poll, PollHistoryAdmin)
    admin.site.register(Choice, SimpleHistoryAdmin)


.. image:: screens/5_history_list_display.png


Customizations
----------------

UUID as `history_id`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``HistoricalRecords`` object can be customized to use an ``UUIDField`` instead
of the default ``IntegerField`` as the object `history_id` either through
Django settings or via the constructor on the model.

.. code-block:: python

    SIMPLE_HISTORY_HISTORY_ID_USE_UUID = True

or

.. code-block:: python

    class UUIDExample(models.Model):
        id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)
        history = HistoricalRecords(
            history_id_field=models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4)
        )


TextField as `history_change_reason`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``HistoricalRecords`` object can be customized to accept a
``TextField`` model field for saving the
`history_change_reason` either through settings or via the constructor on the
model. The common use case for this is for supporting larger model change
histories to support changelog-like features.

.. code-block:: python

    SIMPLE_HISTORY_HISTORY_CHANGE_REASON_USE_TEXT_FIELD=True

or

.. code-block:: python

    class TextFieldExample(models.Model):
        greeting = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        history = HistoricalRecords(
            history_change_reason_field=models.TextField(null=True)
        )


Custom model name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, historical model is named as 'Historical' + model name. For
example, historical records for ``Choice`` is called ``HistoricalChoice``.
Users can specify a custom model name via the constructor on
``HistoricalRecords``. The common use case for this is avoiding naming conflict
if the user already defined a model named as 'Historical' + model name.

.. code-block:: python

    class ModelNameExample(models.Model):
        history = HistoricalRecords(
            custom_model_name='SimpleHistoricalModelNameExample'
        )


Querying history
----------------

Querying history on a model instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``HistoricalRecords`` object on a model instance can be used in the same
way as a model manager:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from polls.models import Poll, Choice
    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> poll = Poll.objects.create(question="what's up?", pub_date=datetime.now())
    >>>
    >>> poll.history.all()
    [<HistoricalPoll: Poll object as of 2010-10-25 18:03:29.855689>]

Whenever a model instance is saved a new historical record is created:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> poll.pub_date = datetime(2007, 4, 1, 0, 0)
    >>> poll.save()
    >>> poll.history.all()
    [<HistoricalPoll: Poll object as of 2010-10-25 18:04:13.814128>, <HistoricalPoll: Poll object as of 2010-10-25 18:03:29.855689>]

Querying history on a model class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Historical records for all instances of a model can be queried by using the
``HistoricalRecords`` manager on the model class.  For example historical
records for all ``Choice`` instances can be queried by using the manager on the
``Choice`` model class:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> choice1 = poll.choice_set.create(choice_text='Not Much', votes=0)
    >>> choice2 = poll.choice_set.create(choice_text='The sky', votes=0)
    >>>
    >>> Choice.history
    <simple_history.manager.HistoryManager object at 0x1cc4290>
    >>> Choice.history.all()
    [<HistoricalChoice: Choice object as of 2010-10-25 18:05:12.183340>, <HistoricalChoice: Choice object as of 2010-10-25 18:04:59.047351>]

Because the history is model, you can also filter it like regularly QuerySets,
a.k. Choice.history.filter(choice_text='Not Much') will work!

Getting previous and next historical record
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a historical record for an instance and would like to retrieve the previous historical record (older) or next historical record (newer), `prev_record` and `next_record` read-only attributes can be used, respectively.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from polls.models import Poll, Choice
    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> poll = Poll.objects.create(question="what's up?", pub_date=datetime.now())
    >>>
    >>> record = poll.history.first()
    >>> record.prev_record
    None
    >>> record.next_record
    None
    >>> poll.question = "what is up?"
    >>> poll.save()
    >>> record.next_record
    <HistoricalPoll: Poll object as of 2010-10-25 18:04:13.814128>

If a historical record is the first record, `prev_record` will be `None`.  Similarly, if it is the latest record, `next_record` will be `None`

Reverting the Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``SimpleHistoryAdmin`` allows users to revert back to an old version of the
model through the admin interface. You can also do this programmatically. To
do so, you can take any historical object, and save the associated instance.
For example, if we want to access the earliest ``HistoricalPoll``, for an
instance of ``Poll``, we can do:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> poll.history.earliest()
    <HistoricalPoll: Poll object as of 2010-10-25 18:04:13.814128>

And to revert to that ``HistoricalPoll`` instance, we can do:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> earliest_poll = poll.history.earliest()
    >>> earliest_poll.instance.save()

This will change the ``poll`` instance to have the data from the
``HistoricalPoll`` object and it will create a new row in the
``HistoricalPoll`` table indicating that a new change has been made.
