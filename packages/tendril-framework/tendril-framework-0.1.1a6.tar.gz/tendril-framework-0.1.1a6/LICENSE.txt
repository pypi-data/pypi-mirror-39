Overview
~~~~~~~~

The Tendril sources are distributed under the terms of various Open Source
Licenses. Each source file contains within it the applicable license for
that file.

In case of any differences between the overview presented here and the actual
license listing within a specific source file, the listing in the source file
will supercede the contents of this file. Any source files not containing an
explicit license listing are distibuted under the terms of the "Dominant
License" listed below.

Licenses for older revisions of source files without explicit licenses listed
may be determined based on the contents of this file AS OF THAT REVISION. For
revisions that do not contain this file, or contain a version of this file
insufficient to determine this license, the license for such files is PROPRIETARY.

The full text of the licenses used are included in the source distribution.

Licensing Roadmap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tendril sources are distributed under the terms of the "Dominant License",
i.e. AGPLv3+, unless otherwise specified within individual source files.
This license is chosen so as to remain compliant with the licenses of the
various open source dependencies of Tendril and to encourage open source
development of Tendril.

Over time, it is intended to refactor and release selected sections of
Tendril under a more permissive license. This refactoring and re-licensing
is proposed to be based on the following considerations, and tentatively
under the listed licenses (in decreasing order of priority) :

* Sections of code necessary for customizing reports, branding, formatting,
  and consequently enhancing integration with pre-existing Processes. (MIT)

* Sections of code which are easily decoupled from the Tendril core and have
  clear applications independent of Tendril. (LGPL)

* Sections of code forming an 'API' that can be used to better integrate
  Tendril functionality with other Software or Infrastructure elements. (LGPL)

* Sections of code forming an 'API' that can be used to extend Tendril
  functionality in ways which are not likely to be included within the Tendril
  core. (LGPL)

* Sections of code clearly unencumbered by upstream licensing concerns. (GPL)
