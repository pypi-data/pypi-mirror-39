Description: ============================================
        Feedforward closed loop learning library/API
        ============================================
        
        The documentation of all functions can be obtained with::
          
            import feedforward_closedloop_learning as fcl
            help(fcl)
        
        The API is identical to the C++ API: The header files `fcl.h`,
        `neuron.h` and `layer.h` contain docstrings for
        all important calls:

        The detailed documentation can be generated with doxygen.
        
        The best way to get started is to look at the script
        in `tests_py`:

        A full application using the Python API is our vizdoom
