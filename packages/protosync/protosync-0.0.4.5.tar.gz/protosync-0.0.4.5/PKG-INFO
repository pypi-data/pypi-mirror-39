Description: # Protosync
        
        Protosync syncs code seamlessly between your local development repo and a remote server. 
        
        No more repeated git commits or long rsync commands just to test code out on the server.
        
        
        ### Install
        ```
        pip install protosync
        ```
        
        
        ### Quick Start
        
        In your **remote** directory, open a **new terminal** and enter:
        ```
        protosync dest
        ```
        Protosync will then print a command like this:
        ```
        protosync source m0X1a-km0C6mCzWkl56xO0-hUQvYrhL0q5I5lK5qZgU=
        ```
        Run this command in your **local** source directory.
        
        And that's it! 
        
        You local code will now be synced to the remote server.  
        Just enter the same command whenever you want to sync again.
        
        **Note:** you'll need to keep the remote terminal running for the sync to work.
        
        ### Facts
        
        * Protosync uses your ```.gitignore``` to automatically ignore unnecessary files.
        * Protosync ignores files larger than **5Mb** to prevent syncing of unwanted binaries.
        * Protosync uses **end-to-end encryption** when syncing your files. The server **cannot** decrypt your data.
