- `ListAddTransactionRequestView`: All payment request should be made on this view. Requires a logged in user.
It'll provide user with required data, including `checksum hash` that will be used with PayTM API.
- `ListAddTransactionResponseView`: All response data should be posted on this view. Doesn't requires a logged in user.
- `PayNowTransaction`: This view is for testing w/o a frontend client. It will open PayTM payment page.

### URLS
- `request/`: All payment request to be made via this URL.
- `response/`: All payment response to be posted on this URL.
