          squelette LANGUAGE NAME DESCRIPTION
        
        Python example
          
          squelette python PACKAGENAME 'A new package'
        
          # If squelette was used from its own virtual environment, 
          # deactivate it
          deactivate   
        
          # Create and activate the new package's development environment
          cd python_test
          0/make_venv.sh
          . venv/bin/activate
        
        The new package will have two executable example scripts
        
          # in setup.py under `scripts`
          bin/hello-PACKAGENAME
        
          # in setup.py under `console_scripts`
          PACKAGENAME
        
        Package commands
        
          # Build the module
          0/build.sh
        
          # Register the built module with PyPI
          # This is no longer required, and in fact seems to be 
          # broken as used here. Ignore this
          0/register.sh
        
          # Upload a new build to PyPI
          0/upload.sh
        
          # Delete all built files
          0/clean.sh
        
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        The version number read by both `setup.py` and the package `__init__.py` 
        is in 
        
           squelette/VERSION
        
        The same command for generated modules apply to `squelette` itself
        
          # This IPython config will set autoreload
          ipython --config=0/ipython_config.py
        
        The files under `venv/bin` generated by the module will have to be rebuilt
        on changes, rebuild with
        
          pip install -e .
