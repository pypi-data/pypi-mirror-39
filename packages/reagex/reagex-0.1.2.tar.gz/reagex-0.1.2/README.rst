The goal of ``reagex`` (from `"readable regular expression"`)
is to suggest a way for writing complex regular expressions with
many capturing groups in a readable way.

At the moment, it contains just one very simple function
(called ``reagex``) and an utility function, but any function
which could be useful for writing readable patterns is welcome.

**Note:** Publishing this ridiculously small project is an excuse to familiarize
with python packaging, DevOps tools and the entire workflow behind the publication
of an open-source project.
The project template was generated using https://github.com/ionelmc/cookiecutter-pylibrary/
which is obviously an overkill for a "one-function-project".

Usage
=====
The core function ``reagex`` is just a wrapper of ``str.format`` and it works
in the same way. See the example

.. code-block:: python

    import re
    from reagex import reagex

    # A sloppy pattern for an italian address (just to show how it works)
    pattern = reagex(
        '{_address}, {postcode} {city} {province}',
        # groups starting with "_" are non-capturing
        _address = reagex(
            '{street} {number}',
            street = '(via|contrada|c/da|c[.]da|piazza|p[.]za|p[.]zza) [a-zA-Z]+',
            number = 'snc|[0-9]+'
        ),
        postcode = '[0-9]{5}',
        city = '[A-Za-z]+',
        province = '[A-Z]{2}'
    )

    matcher = re.compile(pattern)
    match = matcher.fullmatch('via Roma 123, 12345 Napoli NA')
    print(match.groupdict())

    # prints:
    #   {'city': 'Napoli',
    #    'number': '123',
    #    'postcode': '12345',
    #    'province': 'NA',
    #    'street': 'via Roma'}


Groups starting by ``'_'`` are non-capturing. The rest are all named capturing
groups.

Why not...
===========
Why not using just re.VERBOSE?
------------------------------
I think ``reagex`` is easier to write and to read:

* with reagex, you first describe the structure of the pattern in terms of groups,
  `then` you provide a pattern for each group;
  with re.VERBOSE you have to define the groups in the exact position they
  must be matched: to get the high-level structure of the pattern you may need
  to read multiple lines at the same indentation level
* with re.VERBOSE you just write a big string; with reagex you get
  syntax highlighting which helps readability
* white-spaces don't need any special treatment
* "{group_name}" is nicer than "(?P<group_name>)"


Installation
============
::

    pip install reagex


Documentation
=============

https://python-reagex.readthedocs.io/


Development
===========
Possible improvements:

1. make some meaningful use of the ``format_spec``
   in ``{group_name:format_spec}``

2. add utility functions like ``repeated`` to help writing
   common patterns in a readable way


Testing
-------
To run all the tests::

    tox

Note, to combine the coverage data from all the tox environments run:
