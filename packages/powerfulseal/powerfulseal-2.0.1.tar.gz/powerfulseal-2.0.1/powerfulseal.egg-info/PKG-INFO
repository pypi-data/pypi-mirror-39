      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        __PowerfulSeal__ adds chaos to your Kubernetes clusters, so that you can detect problems in your systems as early as possible. It kills targeted pods and takes VMs up and down.
        
        ![Powerful Seal Logo](media/powerful-seal.png)
        
        It follows the [Principles of Chaos Engineering](http://principlesofchaos.org/), and is inspired by [Chaos Monkey](https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey). [Watch the Seal at KubeCon 2017 Austin](https://youtu.be/00BMn0UjsG4).
        
        Embrace the inevitable failure. __Embrace The Seal__.

        ## Highlights
        
        - works with `OpenStack`, `AWS` and local machines
        - speaks `Kubernetes` natively
        - interactive and autonomous, policy-driven mode
        - web interface to interact with PowerfulSeal
        - metric collection and exposition to `Prometheus`
        - minimal setup, easy yaml-based policies
        - easy to extend
        
        
        ## Introduction
        
        __PowerfulSeal__ works in several modes:
        
        - __Interactive__ mode is designed to allow you to discover your cluster's components and manually break things to see what happens. It operates on nodes, pods, deployments and namespaces.
        
        - __Autonomous__ mode reads a policy file, which can contain any number of pod and node scenarios. Each scenario describes a list of matches, filters and actions to execute on your cluster, and will be executed in a loop.
        
        - __Label__ mode allows you to specify which pods to kill with a small number of options by adding `seal/` labels to pods. This is a more imperative alternative to autonomous mode.  
        
        - __Demo__ mode allows you to point the Seal at a cluster and a `heapster` server and let it try to figure out what to kill based on the resource utilisation.
        
        ## Modes of operation
        
        ## Interactive mode

          --openstack           use OpenStack cloud provider
          --aws                 use AWS cloud provider
          --no-cloud            don't use cloud provider
          --openstack-cloud-name OPENSTACK_CLOUD_NAME
                                optional name of the open stack cloud from your config
                                file to use
        
        Inventory settings:
          -i INVENTORY_FILE, --inventory-file INVENTORY_FILE
                                the inventory file of groups of hosts to work with
          --inventory-kubernetes
                                reads all kubernetes cluster nodes as inventory
        
        SSH settings:
          --remote-user REMOTE_USER
                                the of the user for the ssh connections

        ![demo pods](./media/video-pods.gif)
        
        
        ## Autonomous mode
        
        Autonomous reads the scenarios to execute from the policy file, and runs them:
        
        1. The matches are combined together and deduplicated to produce an initial working set
        2. They are run through a series of filters
        3. For all the items remaining after the filters, all actions are executed
        
        ```sh
        $ seal autonomous --help
        usage: seal autonomous [-h] --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG
                               (--openstack | --aws | --no-cloud)

                                file to use
        
        Inventory settings:
          -i INVENTORY_FILE, --inventory-file INVENTORY_FILE
                                the inventory file of groups of hosts to work with
          --inventory-kubernetes
                                reads all kubernetes cluster nodes as inventory

        Metrics settings:
          --stdout-collector    print metrics collected to stdout
          --prometheus-collector
                                store metrics in Prometheus and expose metrics over a
                                HTTP server
        
        Prometheus settings:

                                Host to expose Prometheus metrics via the HTTP server
                                when using the --prometheus-collector flag
          --prometheus-port PROMETHEUS_PORT
                                Port to expose Prometheus metrics via the HTTP server
                                when using the --prometheus-collector flag
        
        Web UI settings:
          --headless            Doesn't start the UI, just runs the policy
          --host HOST           Specify host for the PowerfulSeal web server
          --port PORT           Specify port for the PowerfulSeal web server
        ```
        
        ### Metrics collection
        
        Autonomous mode also comes with the ability for metrics useful for monitoring to be collected. PowerfulSeal currently has a `stdout` and Prometheus collector. However, metric collectors are easily extensible so it is easy to add your own. More details can be found [here](METRICS.md).
        
        ### Web User Interface
        
        #### If you're not going to use the UI, use the flag `--headless` to disable it
        
        PowerfulSeal comes with a web interface to help you navigate Autonomous Mode. Features include:
        
        - starting/stopping autonomous mode
        - viewing and filtering logs
        - changing the configuration (either overwriting the remote policy file or copying the changes to clipboard)
        - stopping/killing individual nodes and pods
        
        
        ![web interface](./media/web.png)
        
        ### Writing policies
        
        A minimal policy file, doing nothing, looks like this:
        
        ```yaml
        config:
          minSecondsBetweenRuns: 77
          maxSecondsBetweenRuns: 100
        
        nodeScenarios: []
        
        podScenarios: [] 
        ```
        
        A more interesting schema, that kills a random pod in `default` namespace every 1-30 seconds:
        
        ```yaml

        ## Label mode
        
        Label mode is a more imperative alternative to autonomous mode, allowing you to specify which specific _per-pod_ whether a pod should be killed, the days/times it can be killed and the probability of it being killed.
        
        To mark a pod for attack, do `kubectl label pods my-app-1 seal/enabled=true`, and the `Seal` will start attacking it, but only during working hours (defaults).
        
        Instructions on how to use label mode can be found in [LABELS.md](LABELS.md).

        ## Demo mode
        
        The main way to use PowerfulSeal is to write a policy file for Autonomous mode which reflects realistic failures in your system. However, PowerfulSeal comes with a demo mode to demonstrate how it can cause chaos on your Kubernetes cluster. Demo mode gets all the pods in the cluster, selects those which are using the most resources, then kills them based on a probability.
        
        Demo mode requires [Heapster](https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster). To run demo mode, use the `demo` subcommand along with `--heapster-path` (path to heapster without a trailing slash, e.g., `http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces-kube-system/services/heapster/proxy`). You can also optionally specify `--aggressiveness` (from `1` (weakest) to `5` (strongest)) inclusive, as well as `--[min/max]-seconds-between-runs`.
        
        ```sh
        $ seal demo --help

        ## Setup
        
        Setup includes:
        - pointing PowerfulSeal at your Kubernetes cluster by giving it a Kubernetes config file
        - pointing PowerfulSeal at your cloud by specifying the cloud driver to use and providing credentials
        - making sure that PowerfulSeal can SSH into the nodes to execute commands on them
        - writing a set of policies
        
        These interactions are available:
        
        ![pipeline](./media/setup.png)
        
        
        ### Minikube setup
        
        It is possible to test a subset of Seal's functionality using a [`minikube`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/) setup. 
        
        To achieve that, please inspect the [Makefile](./Makefile). You will need to override the ssh host, specify the correct username and use minikube's ssh keys.
        
        
        If you'd like to test out the interactive mode, start with this:
        
        ```sh
        seal \
          -vv \
          interactive \
            --no-cloud \
            --inventory-kubernetes \
            --ssh-allow-missing-host-keys \
            --remote-user docker \
            --ssh-path-to-private-key `minikube ssh-key` \
            --override-ssh-host `minikube ip`
        ```
        
        For label mode, try something like this:
        
        ```sh
        seal \
          -vv \
          label \
            --no-cloud \
            --min-seconds-between-runs 3 \
            --max-seconds-between-runs 10 \
            --inventory-kubernetes \
            --ssh-allow-missing-host-keys \
            --remote-user docker \
            --ssh-path-to-private-key `minikube ssh-key` \
            --override-ssh-host `minikube ip`
        ```
        
        For autonomous mode, this should get you started:
        
        ```sh
        seal \
          -vv \
          autonomous \
            --no-cloud \
            --policy-file ./examples/policy_kill_random_default.yml \
            --inventory-kubernetes \
            --prometheus-collector \
            --prometheus-host 0.0.0.0 \
            --prometheus-port 9999 \
            --ssh-allow-missing-host-keys \
            --remote-user docker \
            --ssh-path-to-private-key `minikube ssh-key` \
            --override-ssh-host `minikube ip` \
            --host 0.0.0.0 \
            --port 30100
        ```
        
        
        
        ## Getting started
        
        `PowerfulSeal` is available to install through pip:
        
        ```sh
        pip install powerfulseal
        powerfulseal --help # or seal --help
        ```
        
        To start the web interface, use flags `--server --server-host [HOST] --server-port [PORT]` when starting PowerfulSeal in autonomous mode and visit the web server at `http://HOST:PORT/`.
        
        Both Python 2.7 and Python 3 are supported.
        
        ## Testing
        
        PowerfulSeal uses [tox](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox) to test with multiple versions on Python. The recommended setup is to install and locally activate the Python versions under `tox.ini` with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). 
        
        Once the required Python versions are set up and can be discovered by tox (e.g., by having them discoverable in your PATH), you can run the tests by running `tox`.
        
        For testing the web server and more details on testing, see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

        ## FAQ
        
        ### Where can I learn more about Chaos Engineering ?
        
        We found these two links to be a good start:
        
        - http://principlesofchaos.org/
        - https://github.com/dastergon/awesome-chaos-engineering
        
        ### How is it different from Chaos Monkey ?
        
        PowerfulSeal was inspired by Chaos Monkey, but it differs in a couple of important ways.
        
        The Seal does:
          - speak Kubernetes
          - offer flexible, easy to write YAML scenarios
          - provide interactive mode with awesome tab-completion
        
        The Seal doesn't:
          - need external dependencies (db, Spinnaker), apart from SSH, cloud and Kubernetes API access
          - need you to setup ```cron```
        
        ### Can I contribute to The Seal ?
        
        We would love you to. In particular, it would be great to get help with:
        
        - get more [cloud drivers](./powerfulseal/clouddrivers/driver.py) (currently `OpenStack` and `AWS`)
        - get more [awesome filters](./powerfulseal/policy/scenario.py)
        - <del>__get an amazing logo__</del>
        - make the PowerfulSeal more powerful
        
        Check out our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more information about how to contribute.
        
        ### Why a Seal ?
        
        It might have been inspired by [this comic](https://randowis.com/2015/01/07/the-tower/).
