Installation
============

You need **Python 3.6.4 or greater**.

We advise using the `Anaconda Python distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`__
to ensure that all the dependencies are installed via the ``Conda`` package manager.

Step-by-step installation for users
-----------------------------------

Simply type the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> pip install pylops

Alternatively, you can clone the repository

.. code-block:: bash

   >> git clone https://github.com/Statoil/pylops.git

or download the zip file of the repository (green button in the top right corner of the main github repo page) and
install PyLops from terminal using the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> make install

Step-by-step installation for developers
----------------------------------------
Fork and clone the repository by executing the following in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> git clone https://github.com/your_name_here/pylops.git

The first time you clone the repository run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> make dev-install

If you prefer to build a new Conda enviroment just for PyLops, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> make dev-install_conda

To ensure that everything has been setup correctly, run tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    >> make tests

Make sure no tests fail, this guarantees that the installation has been successfull.

If using Conda environment, always remember to activate the conda environment every time you open
a new *bash* shell by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> source activate pylops
