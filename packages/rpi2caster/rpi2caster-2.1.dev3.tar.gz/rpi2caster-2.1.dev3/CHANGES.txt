v0.4 - point-based calculations; user configuration; length/width objects and something extra ;)
v0.3dev6 - mould preheat quad number bugfix (less by one, to make sure no overlength is cast)
v0.3dev5 - matrix selection regression fix
v0.3dev4 - mould preheat before batch casting
v0.3dev3 - cast sorts/spaces/typecases rework
           diecase selected: choose mats automatically or from menu (for multiple matches),
           diecase not selected: enter coordinates and unit width for each mat
           ditch mould preheat during casting (simple is better than complex)
           HW driver: input sensor debounce delay changed from 50ms to 5ms (may help with slow NI pin)
           UX: unify input prompts
v0.3dev2 - bugfix release
v0.3dev1 - change diecase storage format (diecase_id, typeface, wedge, layout)
	   ditch wedge storage in db; use wedges specified by name
	   LOTS of new stopbar/wedge definitions
	   new diecase methods for matrix lookup
	   new command line parameters (see rpi2caster --help)
           move matrix manipulation to casting and (later) typesetting utilities
           UX: confirmation prompts with default options

	   BREAKS old databases - necessary fix at https://gist.github.com/elegantandrogyne/52c9e89ed9c16f39b356

v0.2dev17 - sorts casting no longer asks for char and style when no matrix case is selected
v0.2dev16 - unit correction bugfix
v0.2dev15 - diecase and matrix remodelling, matrix manipulation utility changes
v0.2dev14 - workflow fixes and code cleanup
v0.2dev13 - better stats display during casting and punching
v0.2dev12 - casting program has typecase casting option and allows user to choose 16th row addressing
