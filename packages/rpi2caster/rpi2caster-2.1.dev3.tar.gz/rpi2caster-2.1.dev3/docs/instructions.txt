Enter:
./rpi2caster.py [c, i]* [-dsp]** [RIBBON_FILE]***

* c = cast, i = inventory management
** -d = debug mode, -s = casting simulation (no caster required), -p = punching
*** ribbon file path for casting, relative or absolute, case-sensitive

example:
./rpi2caster.py c -s tests/helloworld 	(simulate casting a file)
./rpi2caster.py c tests/helloworld	 (cast with a real caster)
./rpi2caster.py c 	(cast with a real caster but choose ribbon from menu)
./rpi2caster c -p tests/helloworld	(punch ribbon)
./rpi2caster.py i 	(inventory management)

HINT: Use shell auto-completion (e.g. "te[TAB]/hel[TAB]").
Filenames are case-sensitive!

Have a nice day!
