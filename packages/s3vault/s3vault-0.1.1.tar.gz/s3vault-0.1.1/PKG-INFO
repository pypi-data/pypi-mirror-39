Description: # s3vault
        
        > A library for storing documents in AWS s3
        
        ## Before you start
        
        For best results, create a bucket with the following settings:
        
        * Encryption on
        * Versioning on
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install s3vault
        ```
        
        **Environment variables**
        
        The following environment variables can optionally be provided:
        
        * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
        * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
        * `AWS_S3_REGION_NAME`
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from s3vault.vault import Vault
        vault = Vault(bucket, owner_id, collection)
        ```
        
        You can also provide `aws_access_key_id`, `aws_secret_access_key` and `aws_s3_region_name`, otherwise if will default to the values in the environment variables above.
        
        ### Upload a file from a url
        
        ```python
        vault.upload_from_url(url, filename, extension='pdf')
        ```
        
        * **url:** the url to fetch the file to store from
        * **filename** the Key at which to store the object. Convention: `:collection/:owner_id/:object_id`
        
        **TODO:** this method should use the same convention as the below methods to enforce consistency
        
        ### Get a file
        
        ```
        vault.get_object(object_id)
        ```
        
        ```
        vault.get_versions(object_id)
        ```
