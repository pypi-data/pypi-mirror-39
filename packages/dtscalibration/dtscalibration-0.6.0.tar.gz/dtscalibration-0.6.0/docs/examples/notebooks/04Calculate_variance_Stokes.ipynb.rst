        }

    6 files were found, each representing a single timestep
    6 recorded vars were found: LAF, ST, AST, REV-ST, REV-AST, TMP
    Recorded at 1693 points along the cable
    The measurement is double ended

    print(ds.variance_stokes.__doc__)

            Calculates the variance between the measurements and a best fit exponential at each
            reference section. This fits a two-parameter exponential to the stokes measurements. The
            temperature is constant and there are no splices/sharp bends in each reference section.
            Therefore all signal decrease is due to differential attenuation, which is the same for
            each reference section. The scale of the exponential does differ per reference section.
    
            Assumptions: 1) the temperature is the same along a reference section. 2) no sharp bends
            and splices in the reference sections. 3) Same type of optical cable in each reference
            section.
    
            Idea from discussion at page 127 in Richter, P. H. (1995). Estimating errors in
            least-squares fitting. For weights used error propagation:
            w^2 = 1/sigma(lny)^2 = y^2/sigma(y)^2 = y^2

The residuals should be normally distributed and independent from
previous time steps and other points along the cable. If you observe
patterns in the residuals plot (above), it might be caused by: - The
temperature in the calibration bath is not uniform - Attenuation caused
by coils/sharp bends in cable - Attenuation caused by a splice

.. code:: ipython3

    residuals.plot.hist(bins=50);
