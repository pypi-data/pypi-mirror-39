But, you also want to be able to use it from your python\napplications, and that's where `aiosql` can help. With `aiosql` you can organize your SQL statements in `.sql`\nfiles and load them into a python object as methods to call.\n\nThis project supports sync and asyncio based drivers for SQLite (`sqlite3`, `aiosqlite`) and PostgreSQL\n(`psycopg2`, `asyncpg`) out of the box, and can be extended to support other database drivers by you! The ``asyncio``\nsupport restricts this package to python versions >3.6. If you are using older versions of python please see the\nrelated [anosql](https://github.com/honza/anosql) package which this project is based on.\n\n## Install\n\n```\npip install aiosql\n```\n\nOr if you you use [poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/):\n\n```\npoetry add aiosql\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nProject and API docs https://nackjicholson.github.io/aiosql\n",
