# Cloudtoken OKTA Auth Plugin

This is an OKTA auth plugin for [Cloudtoken](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/cloudtoken).

## Installation

    $ pip3 install cloudtoken-plugin.okta

## Configuring Cloudtoken

You will need to add the `okta` plugin to auth section your `~/.config/cloudtoken/config.yaml` and have the `saml` plugin
immediately after it. You `config.yaml` should look something like this: 

    auth:
        - okta
        - saml

You will also need to add both a gui flag (for an ugly, but functional popup), and the OKTA url into `config.yaml` as a top level key. Your config.yaml should look something
like this:

    okta_url: 'https://mydomain.okta.com/'
    gui: True
    plugins:
        pre_auth:
        auth:
            - okta
            - saml
        post_auth:
            - export_credentials_shell


## 401's when authenticating?
IIS might be trying to authenticate your credentials using Windows Authentication instead of Forms authentication.

You can follow the instructions [here](http://www.richardawilson.com/2010/10/adfs-20-login-page.html) to fix that.
