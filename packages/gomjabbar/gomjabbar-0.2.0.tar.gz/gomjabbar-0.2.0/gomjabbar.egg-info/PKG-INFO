Description: # gomjabbar
        `gomjabbar` is a package which assists in the creation of unit tests for
        ngspice code models.
        
        The test programs which it creates are run independently of the ngspice
        program. The interface file (`ifspec.ifs`) for the code model is used to
        generate code which initializes the `Mif_Private_t` data structure which
        is used by ngspice to interact with code models. By doing this, it is
        possible for test code to call any function in the code model which
        takes the `ARGS` argument. At a minimum, this includes the entry point
        function for the code model (`C_Function_Name` in `ifspec.ifs`).
