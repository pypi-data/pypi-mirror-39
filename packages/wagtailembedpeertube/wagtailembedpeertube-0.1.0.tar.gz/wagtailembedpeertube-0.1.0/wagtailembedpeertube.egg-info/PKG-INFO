        ## Introduction
        
        Wagtail has a great
        [support of Oembed](http://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.1.1/advanced_topics/embeds.html),
        for embedding content. Unfortunately the Oembed mecanism is based on services
        domain names and URI; and this is prone to centralization since it limits to a
        short list of selected providers.
        
        By the way, currently there is for now more than 300 instances and it will
        probably grow with years. See e.g. https://instances.joinpeertube.org
        
        This app bring Oembed support for decentralized peertube instances.
        
        To do this we only focus on a string URI filtering, allowing all services from
        any domain name.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Requirements
        
        You will need `wagtail.embeds` which is part of Wagtail's core modules.
        
        ### Pip installation
        
            $ pip install wagtailembedpeertube
        
        ## Settings
        
        ### Add the app to your project
        
        You have to add `wagtailembedpeertube` anywhere after `wagtail.embeds` in
        your project settings.
        
        ### Configure embeds finders
        
        You have to declare the peertube finder in your project settings, so Wagtail
        will make use of it.
        
        ```python
        WAGTAILEMBEDS_FINDERS = [
            {
                'class': 'wagtail.embeds.finders.oembed',
            },
            {
                'class': 'wagtailembedpeertube.finders',
            },
        ]
        ```
        Since the first matching finder will be used, you should declare
        `wagtailembedpeertube` as last because others finders are matching domain names
        and may be more precise.
        
        See [Configuring embed “finders”](http://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.1.1/advanced_topics/embeds.html#configuring-embed-finders)
        for more informations.
        
        ## Usage
        
        That's it! You should now be able to embed any peertube content using the
        `EmbedBlock`:
        
        ```python
        from wagtail.embeds.blocks import EmbedBlock
        
        class MyStreamField(blocks.StreamBlock):
            ...
        
            embed = EmbedBlock()
        ```
