Description: pp.core - Produce & Publish Foundation
        ======================================
        
        ``pp.core`` implements some core foundation functionalities
        of the Produce & Publish framework.
        
        Provided functionality
        ----------------------
        
        - filesystem abstraction
        - integration with Dropbox and other cloud file services
        - resource base
        - resources registry
        - filesystem registry  
        
        Internals
        ---------
        
        This module abstracts Produce & Publish basic functionality in order to make
        the core implementation as re-usable as possible.  It uses the ``pyfilesystem``
        to abstract arbitrary file operations independent of the underlaying storage
        layer. Through this approach we are able to support local filesystems, network
        filesystems or cloud storages like Dropbox without changing the application.
        All storage subsystems can be accessed using the same API.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - Python 2.7 
        
        For using the Dropbox storage API of ``pp.core`` you need to have ``Phantomjs``
        installed (the ``phantomjs`` binary must be available in the ``$PATH``. PhantomJS
        is required to fake the OAuth process of Dropbox.

        basis.
