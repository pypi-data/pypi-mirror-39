        RPi-DeviceAdapters is a tool for controlling microscope hardware with
        the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). It provides a common
        software interface to different types of peripherals through
        [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/), an open source software
        package widely used in microscopy.
        
        RPi-DeviceAdapters contains the following tools:
        
        - **[DeviceAdapters](https://github.com/kmdouglass/RPi-DeviceAdapters/tree/master/src/DeviceAdapters)**
          Ready-made Micro-Manager device adapters for various hardware peripherals
        - **[build](https://github.com/kmdouglass/RPi-DeviceAdapters/tree/master/ci/build)** A Docker image
          for cross-compiling Micro-Manager for the Raspberry Pi's ARM processors on a x86 laptop or
          workstation
        - **[app](https://github.com/kmdouglass/RPi-DeviceAdapters/tree/master/ci/app)** A Docker image for
          running the Micro-Manager Python wrapper on the Raspberry Pi and that can be easily downloaded
          onto any Pi that has Docker installed on it
        - **[tacpho.adapters](https://github.com/kmdouglass/RPi-DeviceAdapters/tree/master/tacpho/adapters)**
          A Python package for easily working with the project's Docker images on the Raspberry Pi
        
        In addition, compiled device adapter libraries may be found in the
        [releases](https://github.com/kmdouglass/RPi-DeviceAdapters/releases) page.
        
        ## Quickstart
        
        On a Raspberry Pi that has [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) already
        installed , create a file named `script.py` that contains the
        following lines:
        
        ```
        import MMCorePy
        mmc = MMCorePy.CMMCore()
        print(mmc.getVersionInfo())
        ```
        
        Run the following commands from a terminal window from the same Pi:
        
        ```
        $ pip3 install tacpho.adapters
        $ mm.py pull
        $ mm.py run script.py
        ```
        
        `mm.py pull` may take several minutes to download the
        application on the first use.
