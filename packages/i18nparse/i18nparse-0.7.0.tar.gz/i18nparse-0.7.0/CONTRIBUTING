How to contribute


Installation:

You will first need to clone or fork the project from GitHUB:

git clone https://github.com/s-ball/i18nparse.git


Improving existing translations:

The po files are is the src directory, named as argparge_xx.po, where xx is a
language code. They are text files, so you can easily edit them.


Adding new languages:

The src directory contains the argparse.pot file which is a standard portable
object template. There are plenty of tools allowing to produce and generate a
new po file (GNU gettext, poedit, etc.) and their description is beyond the
object of this text.


Testing locally:

The project comes with a setup.py file that can be used to build distributions,
 or directly install the project.

The recommended way is:
- setup a virtual environment (python -m venv new_env)
- use it (new_env\Scripts\activate on Windows, or new_env/bin/activate on
Unix-likes)
- install the wheel package (pip install wheel)
- build a wheel in the dist directory (python setup bdist_wheel)
- install the wheel (pip install dist\... on Windows or pip install dist/...)

The good news is that in that case pip is able to remove the installation with
 pip uninstall i18nparse, if you want to make a small change

You can then use the installation from that virtual environment.


Upload:

The expected way is to submit a pull request on GitHUB. If you are not
comfortable with that, you can post an issue with the new po file as an
attachment. As I maintain the project on my free time, I cannot guarantee
to always be highly responsive. But as I am very interested in the project
since I created it, be assured that I will do my best to incorporate
additions and improvements.


Caveats:

pot and po files are assumed to use UTF-8. Beware when using Windows...

The "compiled" mo files (for machine object) and generated by setup.py during
 the build phase. That means that they will never exist in the source tree.
Be sure to never import from the source tree for that reason...
