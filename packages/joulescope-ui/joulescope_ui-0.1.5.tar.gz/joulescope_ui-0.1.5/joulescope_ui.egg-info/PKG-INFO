Description: 
        # Joulescope
        
        Welcome to Joulescope™!  Joulescope is an inexpensive, precision energy 
        analyzer that enables you to build better products. 
        Joulescope™ accurately and simultaneously measures the voltage and current 
        supplied to your target device, and it then computes power and energy. 
        For more information on Joulescope, see 
        [www.joulescope.com](https://www.joulescope.com).
        
        The Joulescope graphical user interface runs on a host PC 
        and communicates with the Joulescope device over USB.  The application
        source code is available at https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_ui.
        In addition to the graphical user interface, the source code is
        a Python 3.6+ package.
        The code currently runs under Windows 10. 
        Linux and Mac OS/X drivers will be before 2019.
