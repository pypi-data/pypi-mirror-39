  description: >
    This ATAC-seq pipeline closely follows the official ENCODE DCC pipeline. It is comprised of
    three steps; alignment, pre-peakcall QC, and calling peaks (with post-peakcall QC).

    First, reads are aligned to a genome using
    [Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml) aligner. Next, pre-peakcall QC
    metrics are calculated. QC report contains ENCODE 3 proposed QC metrics --
    [NRF, PBC bottlenecking coefficients](https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/terms/),
    [NSC, and RSC](https://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/qualityMetrics.html#chipSeq). Finally, the peaks
    are called using [MACS2](https://github.com/taoliu/MACS/). The post-peakcall QC report
    includes additional QC metrics -- number of peaks, fraction of reads in peaks (FRiP), number
    of reads in peaks, and if promoter regions BED file is provided, number of reads in
    promoter regions, fraction of reads in promoter regions, number of peaks in promoter regions,
    and fraction of reads in promoter regions.

            While '--nomodel' is set, MACS uses this parameter to extend reads in 5'->3' direction
            to fix-sized fragments. For example, if the size of binding region for your
            transcription factor is 200 bp, and you want to bypass the model building by MACS,
            this parameter can be set as 200. This option is only valid when --nomodel is set or
            when MACS fails to build model and --fix-bimodal is on.

            Note, this is NOT the legacy --shiftsize option which is replaced by --extsize! You
            can set an arbitrary shift in bp here. Please Use discretion while setting it other
            than default value (0). When --nomodel is set, MACS will use this value to move
            cutting ends (5') then apply --extsize from 5' to 3' direction to extend them to
            fragments. When this value is negative, ends will be moved toward 3'->5' direction,
            otherwise 5'->3' direction. Recommended to keep it as default 0 for ChIP-Seq datasets,
            or -1 * half of EXTSIZE together with --extsize option for detecting enriched cutting
            loci such as certain DNAseI-Seq datasets. Note, you can't set values other than 0 if
