class ExternalPlayer(BasePlayer):
    """
    The RL player in the gym environment wants to initiate control by
        invoking the step() function. This step function sends an action, lets the environment simulate and then
        receives an observation back from the environment.
    In this schieber environment the control is initiated by the Game and not by the player. This is why we need this
        architecture with this external player. The external player blocks when its choose_card() method is called and
        sends the current state received by the Game as an observation to the rl player from gym who connects via a
        websocket. Then the rl agent selects an action and sends it back to this external player. The external player
        submits this action as the chosen card to the Game. The Game simulates the game and this process starts over.
        With the help of this architecture we can use the benefits of the standardized gym environments with many
        rl methods which are already implemented (openai baselines: https://github.com/openai/baselines).
