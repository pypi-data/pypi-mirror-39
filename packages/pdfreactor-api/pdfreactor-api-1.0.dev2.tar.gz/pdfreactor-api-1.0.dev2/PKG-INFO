        ==============
        pdfreactor-api
        ==============
        
        Python API for PDFreactor (https://www.pdfreactor.com), a HTML-to-PDF processor.
        
        This distribution package is based on the original API module by RealObjects.
        To make use of it, you need
        
        - a license key (from `RealObjects`_; see https://www.pdfreactor.com/buy/)
        - a running PDFreactor server.
        
        .. _RealObjects: https://www.realobjects.com/
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - The module ``pdfreactor.api`` contains the Python API version 6
          (based on ``wrappers/python/lib/PDFreactor.py`` from the PDFreactor tarball),
          suitable to talk to PDFreactor server versions 8 to 10.
        
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Some sample scripts are contained in the ``docs/sample/`` directory:
        
        simple.py
            A sample demonstrating the simple integration of PDFreactor into Python applications
        async.py
            A sample demonstrating an asynchronous integration which is recommended for medium to large documents
        stream.py
            A sample demonstrating how converted PDFs can be streamed, thus conserving memory

            pip install pdfreactor-api
        
        Or, to integrate in a project built using `zc.buildout`_,
        add to your ``buildout.cfg`` script::
        
            [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                pdfreactor-api
        
        and then run ``bin/buildout``.
