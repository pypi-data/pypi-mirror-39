Description: # EVM CFG BUILDER
        
        Use this library to extract a control flow graph (CFG) from EVM bytecode. `evm_cfg_builder` is used by Ethersplay, Manticore, and many other tools from Trail of Bits.
        
        ## Features
        
        evm_cfg_builder is a work in progress, but it's already very useful today:
        
        * Reliably recovers a Control Flow Graph (CFG) from EVM bytecode
        * Recovers attributes (e.g., payable, view, pure)
        * Outputs the CFG to a dot file
        
        `evm_cfg_builder` is a reliable foundation to build many possible program analysis tools for EVM. This library is covered by our standard bounty policy and we encourage contributions that address any known [issues](https://github.com/trailofbits/evm_cfg_builder/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc). Join us on the [Empire Hacking Slack](https://empireslacking.herokuapp.com) to discuss using or extending evm_cfg_builder.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Command line
        To export basic dissassembly information, run:
        ```
        evm-cfg-builder mycontract.evm 
        ```
        To export the CFG of each function (dot format), run:
        ```
        evm-cfg-builder mycontract.evm --export-dot my_dir 
        ```
        dot files can be read using xdot.
        
        ### Library
        See [examples/library.py](examples/library.py) for an example.
