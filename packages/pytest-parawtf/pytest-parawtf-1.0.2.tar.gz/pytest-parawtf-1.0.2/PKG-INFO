        ==============
        
        Ever wondered how pytest_ decides to spell parametrise?  Was it
        parameterize?  Parametrise?  Parametrize?
        
        Confused yet?  Stop worrying, install this plugin and all variants are
        valid::
        
           @pytest.mark.parametrize('a', [0, 1])
           @pytest.mark.parameterize('b', [2, 3])
           @pytest.mark.parametrise('c', [4, 5])
           @pytest.mark.parametrise('d', [6, 7])
           def test_wtf(a, b, c, d):
               assert a in [0, 1]
               assert b in [2, 3]
               assert c in [4, 5]
               assert d in [6, 7]
        
        But if you've ever parametrised a fixture, you may wonder why it's yet
        another spelling over there: ``@pytest.fixture(params=[0, 1])``.  Fear
        not, you can now be consistent::
        
           @pytest.mark.params('a', [0, 1])
           def test_simple(a):
               assert a in [0, 1]
        
        What about when you implement the ``pytest_generate_tests`` hook in
        your ``conftest.py`` file?  We got you covered, ``metafunc.params()``
        and the other (in)sane variations are now valid too.
        
        
        Monkey see, monkey do
        =====================
        
        This plugin monkeypatches the core pytest in ways which should never
        be done.  In other words it voids all your warranties.  Use at your
        own risk.
