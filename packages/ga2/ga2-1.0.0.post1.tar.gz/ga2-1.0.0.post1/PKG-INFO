Description: # Genetic Algorithm Utility for python
        
        ### What is Genetic Algorithm ?
        Genetic Algorithm is inspired by the natural selection process in our environment. GA is very good for optimisation problems , read more about  [GA here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) . 
        
        ### The ga2 module 
        ga2 is a highly flexible and easy to use utility module implementing Genetic Algorithm. 
        
        ### Installation
        * standard pip3 installation is supported
        ```
        pip3 install ga2
        ```
        
        * upgrading
        ```
        pip3 install --upgrade --no-cache ga2==1.0.0
        ```
        
        * import the Genetic Algorithm utility as 
        ```
        import ga2.gaDisc as gad
        
        session1 = gad.Session()
        print(session1.sessID)
        ```
        this should print the session ID of that session
        
        ### Usage
        ga2 is designed to be flexible and also simple to use for a variety of use cases, check the [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for examples. Documentation will be done as soon as a stable stage is reached
        
        ### Current Development
        gaDisc (Genetic Algorithm Discrete) is working and is in its first release stage, a lot of planning and designing needs to be done for gaCont (Genetic Algorithm continuous), which I hope will be soon !.
