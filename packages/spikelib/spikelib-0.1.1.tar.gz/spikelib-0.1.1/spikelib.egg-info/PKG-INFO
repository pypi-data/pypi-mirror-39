Description: # spikelib
        
        A Python package for reading, manipulating, analyzing and visualize spike
        sorted extracellular data.
        The spikelib was designed to give a suite of tools that allow us to analyze
        spiketrains from multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings obtained from some
        spike sorting software (for example spiking-circus).
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Dependencies
        This is the list dependencies
        
        
        ```sh
        pip install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn peakutils pandas h5py lmfit
        ```
        
        Optionally you can install neuroshare to read .mcd files. But it only work on
        Python 2.7
        ```sh
        pip install neuroshare
        ```
        
        ### Install
        There are 2 ways to install spikelib, from Pypi or github. The easier way is install using pip.
        
        ```sh
        pip install spikelib
        ```
        
        Alternatively, you can install the latest version of spikelib from github  running the following commands:
        
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/creyesp/spikelib
        cd spikelib
        python setup.py [install, develop]
        ```
        
        Where the develop argument should be used if you want to modify the code.
