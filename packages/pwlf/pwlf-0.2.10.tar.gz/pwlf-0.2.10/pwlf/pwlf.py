        A function which uses multi start LBFGSB optimization to find the
        location of break points for a given number of line segments by
        minimizing the sum of the square of the errors.

        The idea is that we generate n random latin hypercube samples
        and run LBFGSB optimization on each one. This isn't guaranteed to
        find the global optimum. It's suppose to be a reasonable compromise
        between speed and quality of fit. Let me know how it works.

        Since this is based on random sampling, you might want to run it
        multiple times and save the best version... The best version will
        have the lowest self.ssr (sum of square of residuals)

        There is no guarantee that this will be faster than fit(), however
        you may find it much faster sometimes.

        Input:
        the number of line segments that you want to find
        the optimum break points for
        ex:
        breaks = fitfast(3)

        Output:
        returns the break points of the optimal piecewise continuous lines


        The default number of multi start optimizations is 2.
        - Decreasing this number will result in a faster run time.
        - Increasing this number will improve the likelihood of finding
          good results
        - You can specify the number of starts using the following call
        - Minimum value of pop is 2

        Examples:

        # finds 3 piecewise line segments with 30 multi start optimizations
        breaks = fitfast(3,30)

        # finds 7 piecewise line segments with 50 multi start optimizations

        """
        Calculate the prediction variance for each x location. The prediction
        variance is the uncertainty of the model due to the lack of data.
        This can be used to find a 95% confidence interval of possible
        piecewise linear models based on the current data. This would be
        done typically as y_hat +- 1.96*np.sqrt(pre_var). The
        prediction_variance needs to be calculated at various x locations.
        For more information see:
        www2.mae.ufl.edu/haftka/vvuq/lectures/Regression-accuracy.pptx

        This assumes that your break point locations are exact! and does
        not consider the uncertainty with your break point locations.

        Example:
        see examples/prediction_variance.py

        pre_var = PiecewiseLinFit.prediction_variance(x)
