    """
    Top-level class for operation of the Spectra program. Instantiated by the master GUI widget very
    shortly after initialization. Is expected to persist across multiple windows when used as a plugin.

    The program itself is conceptually divided into three parts that form a pipeline:
        Search/input - translations for the program to parse have to come from somewhere, and usually it's a JSON
        dictionary loaded from outside. The search component handles all search functionality and sends queries
        to the lexer at certain points when the old information is ready to be overwritten by new information.

        Lexer/processing - A translation consists of a series of strokes mapped to an English word, and it is the
        lexer's job to match pieces of each using a dictionary of rules it has loaded from storage. All rules handling
        is done by the lexer component, including parsing them from JSON files on disk and converting them back
        if need be. All results are handed off to the output component, which decides their fate.

        Display/output - The lexer provides its output (usually a rule constructed from user input) to this component
        which puts it in its final form for the GUI to display, including the text graph and the steno board layout
        diagram. This is strictly one-way - no information needs to pass back to the lexer or search from here.

    This class glues these three components together, handling communication between each one and the GUI as well as
    passing information from one stage of the pipeline to the next. Facilitating communication is *all* it should do;
    any actual software functionality should be implemented in one of the three component classes or the GUI.

    This object must handle calls from above as well as below; in particular, the search engine must be able to
    accept dictionaries from the main window, and the lexer must be able to accept queries from the Plover layer.
