    Base class for any component that sends and receives commands from the Spectra engine.
    It is the root class of the Spectra lexer object hierarchy, being subclassed directly
    or indirectly by nearly every important (externally-visible) piece of the program.
    As such, it cannot depend on anything inside the package itself.

    The super() method is unreliable with extended multiple-inheritance hierarchies. It is far
    too easy for one of the many ancestors of a class (some of which may be from external libraries)
    to break the super() call chain on the way to __init__ in this class. For this reason,
    initialization is skipped and instance attributes are checked dynamically as properties. """
