pyUmbral is a python implementation of David Nuñez's threshold proxy re-encryption scheme: Umbral_.
Implemented with OpenSSL_ and Cryptography.io_, pyUmbral is a referential and open-source cryptography library
extending the traditional cryptological narrative of "Alice and Bob" by introducing a new actor,
*Ursula*, who has the ability to take secrets encrypted for Alice and *re-encrypt* them for Bob.

Usage
=====

**Key Generation**

.. code-block:: python

    from umbral import pre, keys, signing

    # Generate Umbral keys for Alice.
    alices_private_key = keys.UmbralPrivateKey.gen_key()
    alices_public_key = alices_private_key.get_pubkey()

    alices_signing_key = keys.UmbralPrivateKey.gen_key()
    alices_verifying_key = alices_signing_key.get_pubkey()
    alices_signer = signing.Signer(private_key=alices_signing_key)

    # Generate Umbral keys for Bob.
    bobs_private_key = keys.UmbralPrivateKey.gen_key()
    bobs_public_key = bobs_private_key.get_pubkey()


**Encryption**

.. code-block:: python

    # Encrypt data with Alice's public key.
    plaintext = b'Proxy Re-encryption is cool!'
    ciphertext, capsule = pre.encrypt(alices_public_key, plaintext)

    # Decrypt data with Alice's private key.
    cleartext = pre.decrypt(ciphertext=ciphertext, 
                            capsule=capsule, 
                            decrypting_key=alices_private_key)


**Re-Encryption Key Fragments**

.. code-block:: python

    # Alice generates "M of N" re-encryption key fragments (or "KFrags") for Bob.
    # In this example, 10 out of 20.
    kfrags = pre.generate_kfrags(delegating_privkey=alices_private_key,
                                 signer=alices_signer,
                                 receiving_pubkey=bobs_public_key,
                                 threshold=10,
                                 N=20)


**Re-Encryption**

.. code-block:: python

  # Several Ursulas perform re-encryption, and Bob collects the resulting `cfrags`.
  # He must gather at least `threshold` `cfrags` in order to activate the capsule.

  capsule.set_correctness_keys(delegating=alices_public_key,
                               receiving=bobs_public_key,
                               verifying=alices_verifying_key)

  cfrags = list()           # Bob's cfrag collection
  for kfrag in kfrags[:10]:
    cfrag = pre.reencrypt(kfrag=kfrag, capsule=capsule)
    cfrags.append(cfrag)    # Bob collects a cfrag


**Decryption by Bob**

.. code-block:: python

  # Bob activates and opens the capsule
  for cfrag in cfrags:
    capsule.attach_cfrag(cfrag)

  bob_cleartext = pre.decrypt(ciphertext=ciphertext, 
                              capsule=capsule, 
                              decrypting_key=bobs_private_key)
  assert bob_cleartext == plaintext

Quick Installation
==================

To install pyUmbral, simply use `pip`:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip3 install umbral


Alternatively, you can checkout the repo and install it from there. 
The NuCypher team uses pipenv for managing pyUmbral's dependencies.
The recommended installation procedure is as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pip3 install pipenv
    $ pipenv install

Post-installation, you can activate the project virtual environment
in your current terminal session by running :bash:`pipenv shell`.

For more information on pipenv, find the official documentation here: https://docs.pipenv.org/.
