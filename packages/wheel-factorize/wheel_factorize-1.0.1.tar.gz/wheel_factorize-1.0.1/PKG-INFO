Description: # wheel_factorize
        
        Wheel factorization is an improvement of trial division method for
        integer factorization. This project is the Python implementation of
        wheel factorization.

        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from wheel_factorize import WheelFactor as WF
        
        wf = WF(3)                  # basis size
        print(wf.factors(10))
        print(wf.factors(31))
        print(wf.factors(22222222222))
        print(wf.is_prime(9999991))
        ```
