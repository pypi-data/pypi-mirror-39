# SafirPy

SafirPy is a Python wrapper to the finite element solver Safir, aimed to provide extended features. Currently, it is able to run Monte Carlo simulations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

[Safir 2016](https://www.uee.uliege.be/cms/c_2383458/en/safir) and [Python 3.6](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or later.


### Installation

#### pip

pip is a package management system for installing and updating Python packages. pip comes with Python, so you get pip simply by installing Python. On Ubuntu and Fedora Linux, you can simply use your system package manager to install the `python3-pip` package. [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python ](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/) provides some guidance on how to install Python on your system if it isn't already; you can also install Python directly from [python.org](https://www.python.org/getit/). You might want to [upgrade pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) before using it to install other programs.

SafirPy uses Python, and as of Oct 2018 SafirPy only works in Python3. 

1.	If you are using Windows with Python version 3.3 or higher, use the [Python Launcher for Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html?highlight=shebang#python-launcher-for-windows) to use `pip` with Python version 3:
    ```sh
    pip install safirpy
    ```
2.	If your system has a `python3` command (standard on Unix-like systems), install with:
    ```sh
    python3 -m pip install safirpy
    ```
3.	You can also just use the `python` command directly, but this will use the _current_ version of Python in your environment:
    ```sh
    python -m pip install safirpy
    ```

### Usage

To run the Monte Carlo toolbox use the following commands.

```sh
python -m safirpy.mc
```
