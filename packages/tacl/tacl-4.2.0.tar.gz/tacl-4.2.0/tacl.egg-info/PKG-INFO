Description: TACL
        ====
        
        tacl is a tool for performing basic text analysis on the texts
        available from the `Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association`_
        (CBETA). It is largely generic, however, and can operate with minor
        modifications on other corpora.
        
        The code is developed at https://github.com/ajenhl/tacl/ and the
        documentation is available at http://tacl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Using `Python 3`_ (minimum version 3.5), either run ``pip install
        tacl`` or download the code manually and run ``python setup.py
        install``. The dependencies are installed automatically when tacl is
        installed with ``pip``. Note however that on Windows (and perhaps Mac
        OS X) it is very likely that the dependencies that have non-Python
        components will not build due to a missing compiler. In such a case,
        follow the instructions at
        https://github.com/ajenhl/tacl/wiki/Installation
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Run ``tacl -h`` for a listing of available subcommands, and ``tacl
        <subcommand> -h`` for help on a specific subcommand.
