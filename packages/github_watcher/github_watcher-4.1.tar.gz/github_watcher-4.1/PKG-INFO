Description: 
        github_watcher is a package for keeping an eye for pull requests that fulfill certain criteria. If you're overseeing some tricky lines of code, you can get an alert and a link to any pull request that modifies those lines.
        
        You can also specify a list of regular expressions for which to watch each pull request. If you get a match in any file (source or destination) in any PR you'll get an alert and a link to it.
