# elementals
Python package with basic utilities for CTF scripts (works well for exploit PoCs too).

## Install
```pip install elementals```

## Brief
The **elementals** python package is a utility package with handy tools for CTF scripts and PoC-style scripts. What was first implemented for personal use in small research scripts was now upgraded to be used by security researchers as a lightweight substitute to the famous pwntools package.

The features included in **elementals** are:
* **Logger:** Basic (logging based) logger - configured and ready to use 
* **Prompter:** Metasploit based stdout wrapper for the logger
* **ProgressBar:** User-friendly graphical progress bar
* **StatusBar:** User-friendly graphical status bar
* **createAnchor:** Creates a time-stamped output directory for all script outputs
* **hexDump:** Stylized hex dump for binary blobs / strings

Here is a screenshot from an example script with most of the features:

And here is the log that is stored behind the scenes:
