// Core mathematical routines.
//
// A quick note on terminology here.
//
// There are a bunch kinds of probabilities used commonly in genomics:
//
// -- pError: the probability of being wrong.
// -- pTrue: the probability of being correct.
//
// Normalized probabilities vs. unnormalized likelihoods:
//
// -- Normalized probabilities: p_1, ..., p_n such that sum(p_i) == 1 are said
//    said to be normalized because they represent a valid probability
//    distribution over the states 1 ... n.
// -- Unnormalized likelihoods: p_1, ..., p_n where sum(p_i) != 1. These are not
//    normalized and so aren't a valid probabilities distribution.
//
// To add even more complexity, probabilities are often represented in three
// semi-equivalent spaces:
//
// -- Real-space: the classic space, with values ranging from [0.0, 1.0]
//    inclusive.
// -- log10-space: If p is the real-space value, in log10-space this would be
//    represented as log10(p). How the p == 0 case is handled is often function
//    dependent, which may accept/return -Inf or not handle the case entirely.
// -- Phred-scaled: See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score for
//    more information. But briefly, the Phred-scale maintains resolution in the
//    lower parts of the probability space using integer quality scores (though
//    using ints is optional, really). The phred-scale is defined as
//
//      `phred(p) = -10 * log10(p)`
//
//    where p is a real-space probability.
//
// The code in math.h dealing with probabilities is very explicit about what
// kind probability and representation is expects and returns, as unfortunately
// these are all represented commonly as doubles in C++. Though tempting to
// address this issue with classic software engineering practices like creating
// a Probability class, in practice this is extremely difficult to do as this
// code is often performance critical and the low-level mathematical operations
// used in this code (e.g., log10) don't distiguish themselves among the types
// of probabilities.
