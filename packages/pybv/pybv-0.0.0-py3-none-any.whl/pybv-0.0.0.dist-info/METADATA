# pybv

A lightweight I/O utility for the BrainVision data format, written in Python.

**See the [pybv documentation](https://pybv.readthedocs.io) for more
information.**

**ALPHA SOFTWARE**. This package is currently in its early stages of iteration.
It may change both its internals or its user-facing API in the near future. Any
feedback and ideas on how to improve either of these is more than welcome!

## Acknowledgements

This package was originally adapted from
[palday](https://palday.bitbucket.io/)'s
[Philistine package](https://gitlab.com/palday/philistine). It copies much of
the BrainVision exporting code, removes the dependence on MNE, and focuses the
code around BrainVision I/O.
