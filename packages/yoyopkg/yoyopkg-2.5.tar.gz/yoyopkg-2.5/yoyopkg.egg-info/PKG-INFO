Description: # Yoyo
        
        > Want a better cross platform way to install program ?
        > Yoyo help you to do this thanks to little `.yoyo` files containing easy to made instructions
        
        ## How does it work ?
        
        - Just type `yoyo install PACKAGE_NAME`
        - Yoyo will then resolve dependencies and install it
        - Later you can also customize yoyo install files to create installations for your own software
        
        ## Yoyo CLI
        `usage: yoyo.py [-h] [--local] [--force] [--nocache]
                       {install,remove,update,list,details,verify} [package]`
        
        Modes:
        - `install [package name]` Install a package
        
          - `--local` to install it locally
          - `--force` to install it even if already installed
          - `--nocache` to download it again and dont use cache
        
        - `remove [package name]` Remove a package
        - `list` List all packages
        - `details` List all packages with details (desc and req)
        - `update` Update list of packages
        - `verify {package name}` Verify than all package (or one if specified) are installed
        
        
        ## Instructions to write a `yoyo` file
        
        Create a `.yoyo` file and store it in: `~/.yoyo/store/y_local/modules/`
        
        You will have to put in:
        
        - NAME (name)
        
            Set a install name. Name used for `yoyo install`.
            ```
            NAME anaconda
            ```
        
        - AUTHOR (name)
        
            Set a author name. Only use for information.
            ```
            AUTHOR anaconda team
            ```
        
        - INFO (informations)
        
            Set a description. Only use for information.
            ```
            INFO Anaconda is a package manager for python
            ```
        
        - VERSION (version)
        
            Set a version.
            ```
            VERSION 3.5.2.0
            ```
        
        - REQ (req1, reqX,...)
        
            Set requirements. Requirements are the name of other packages.
            ```
            REQ python, curl
            ```
        
        Then you will have to fill `functions`
        
        ### `[INSTALL]`
        
        Inside, write all methods to install the package.
        
        ### `[VERIFY]`
        
        Inside, write all methods to verify the package is well installed
        
        ### Instruction for these functions:
        
        - LET (name, value)
        
            Create a variable and assign it value
            ```
            LET url https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
            ```
            To access a variable just type `#name`.\
            To concatenate them use `#var1+#var2`
        
        - SAVEDIR
        
            Save the current dir in memory
            ```
            SAVEDIR
            ```
        
        - CHDIR (dir)
        
            Change current dir to dir
            ```
            CHDIR /tmp/anaconda
            ```
        
        - RESTOREDIR
        
            Restore current dir to the savedir one
            ```
            RESTOREDIR
            ```
        
        - DL (url, folder, name)
        
            Download url and save it to folder/name
            ```
            DL #url #INSTALLDIR __anaconda_install.tar.gz
            ```
        
        - CMD (command)
        
            Execute command
            ```
            CMD sh #INSTALLDIR+__anaconda_install.tar.gz
            ```
            You can set some options like
            ```
            NOCHECK dont check the command return code. In normal time if return code != 0, install will be stopped.
            HIDE hide the command output
            ```
            These options must be placed before the command
            ```
            CMD NOCHECK exit 1
            CMD HIDE NOCHECK tree /
            ```
        
        - PRINT (str)
        
            Print a string
            ```
            PRINT Installing anaconda... it can takes some time. Install to #INSTALLDIR
            ```
        
        - You can have `if` like statements
        
            - LOCAL
            - Windows
            - MacOS
            - Linux
        
            And combine this with
        
            - ELSE
            - END
        
            ```
            - LOCAL
            PRINT User want a local install
            - ELSE
            CMD sudo install
            - END
        
            - Windows
            PRINT Windows user
            CMD chocolatey install #choco_name
            - END
            ```
        
        `// Is use to comment a line`
        
        - DEFAULT
        
            Is use to use default command to verify or install
            ```
            [VERIFY]
            DEFAULT -> This will call `which #NAME` on linux
        
            [INSTALL]
            DEFAULT -> This will call `sudo apt install #NAME` on linux
            ```
