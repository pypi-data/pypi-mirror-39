        DeepCpG [1]_ is a deep neural network for predicting the methylation state of CpG dinucleotides in multiple cells. It allows to accurately impute incomplete DNA methylation profiles, to discover predictive sequence motifs, and to quantify the effect of sequence mutations. (`Angermueller et al, 2017 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-017-1189-z>`_).

           **DeepCpG model architecture and applications.**
        
           \(a\) Sparse single-cell CpG profiles as obtained from scBS-seq or scRRBS-seq. Methylated CpG sites are denoted by ones, unmethylated CpG sites by zeros, and question marks denote CpG sites with unknown methylation state (missing data). (b) DeepCpG model architecture. The DNA model consists of two convolutional and pooling layers to identify predictive motifs from the local sequence context, and one fully connected layer to model motif interactions. The CpG model scans the CpG neighborhood of multiple cells (rows in b), using a bidirectional gated recurrent network (GRU), yielding compressed features in a vector of constant size. The Joint model learns interactions between higher-level features derived from the DNA- and CpG model to predict methylation states in all cells. (c, d) The trained DeepCpG model can be used for different downstream analyses, including genome-wide imputation of missing CpG sites (c) and the discovery of DNA sequence motifs that are associated with DNA methylation levels or cell-to-cell variability (d).

        Installation
        ============
        
        The easiest way to install DeepCpG is to use ``PyPI``:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
          pip install deepcpg
        
        Alternatively, you can checkout the repository,
        
        .. code:: bash
        
          git clone https://github.com/cangermueller/deepcpg.git
        
        
        and then install DeepCpG using ``setup.py``:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
          python setup.py install
        
        
        Getting started
        ===============
        
        1. Store known CpG methylation states of each cell into a tab-delimted file with the following columns:
        
        * Chromosome (without chr)
        * Position of the CpG site on the chromosome starting with one
        * Binary methylation state of the CpG sites (0=unmethylation, 1=methylated)
        
        Example:
        
        .. code::
        
          1   3000827   1.0
          1   3001007   0.0
          1   3001018   1.0
          ...
          Y   90829839  1.0
          Y   90829899  1.0
          Y   90829918  0.0
        
        
        2. Run ``dcpg_data.py`` to create the input data for DeepCpG:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
          dcpg_data.py
          --cpg_profiles ./cpg/cell1.tsv ./cpg/cell2.tsv ./cpg/cell3.tsv
          --dna_files ./dna/mm10
          --cpg_wlen 50
          --dna_wlen 1001
          --out_dir ./data
        
        ``./cpg/cell[123].tsv`` store the methylation data from step 1., ``./dna`` contains the DNA database, e.g. `mm10 <http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-85/fasta/mus_musculus/dna/>`_ for mouse or `hg38 <http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-86/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/>`_ for human, and output data files will be stored in ``./data``.
        
        
        3. Fine-tune a pre-trained model or train your own model from scratch with ``dcpg_train.py``:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
          dcpg_train.py
            ./data/c{1,3,6,7,9}_*.h5
            --val_data ./data/c{13,14,15,16,17,18,19}_*.h5
            --dna_model CnnL2h128
            --cpg_model RnnL1
            --joint_model JointL2h512
            --nb_epoch 30
            --out_dir ./model
        
        This command uses chromosomes 1-3 for training and 10-13 for validation. ``---dna_model``, ``--cpg_model``, and ``--joint_model`` specify the architecture of the CpG, DNA, and Joint model, respectively (see manuscript for details). Training will stop after at most 30 epochs and model files will be stored in ``./model``.
        
        
        4. Use ``dcpg_eval.py`` to impute methylation profiles and evaluate model performances.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
          dcpg_eval.py
            ./data/*.h5
            --model_files ./model/model.json ./model/model_weights_val.h5
            --out_data ./eval/data.h5
            --out_report ./eval/report.tsv
        
        This command predicts missing methylation states on all chromosomes and evaluates prediction performances using known methylation states. Predicted states will be stored in ``./eval/data.h5`` and performance metrics in ``./eval/report.tsv``.
        
        
        5. Export imputed methylation profiles to HDF5 or bedGraph files:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
          dcpg_eval_export.py
            ./eval/data.h5
            -o ./eval/hdf
            -f hdf

        FAQ
        ===
        
        **Why am I getting warnings 'No CpG site at position X!' when using `dcpg_data.py`?**
        This means that some sites in ``--cpg_profile`` files are not CpG sites, i.e. there is no CG dinucleotide at the given position in the DNA sequence. Make sure that ``--dna_files`` point to the correct genome and CpG sites are correctly aligned. Since DeepCpG currently does not support allele-specific methylation, data from different alleles must be merged (recommended) or only one allele be used.
        
        **How can I train models on one or more GPUs?**
        DeepCpG use the `Keras <https://keras.io>`_ deep learning library, which supports `Theano <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/>`_ or `Tensorflow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ as backend. If you are using Tensorflow, DeepCpG will automatically run on all available GPUs. If you are using Theano, you have to set the flag `device=GPU` in the `THEANO_FLAGS` environment variable.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
          THEANO_FLAGS='device=gpu,floatX=float32'
        
        You can find more information about Keras backends `here <https://keras.io/backend/>`_, and about parallelization `here <https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-run-keras-on-gpu>`_.
