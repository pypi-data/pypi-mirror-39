django-todopago
===============

This library integrates TodoPago with Django. It's kind of rushed, but has been
working in production for months (probably over a year).

Django 2.0 and 2.1 are supported, and only Python 3.7 has been tested to work
as expected.

There's little docs, and lot's of guesswork to using it. Docs and more README
is welcome.
