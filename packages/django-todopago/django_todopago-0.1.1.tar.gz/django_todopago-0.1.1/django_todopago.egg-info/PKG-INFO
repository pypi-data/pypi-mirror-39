        ===============
        
        This library integrates TodoPago with Django. It's kind of rushed, but has been
        working in production for months (probably over a year).
        
        Django 2.0 and 2.1 are supported, and only Python 3.7 has been tested to work
        as expected.
        
        There's little docs, and lot's of guesswork to using it. Docs and more README
        is welcome.
