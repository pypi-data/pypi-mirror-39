Description: # awd
        
        a window director;
        
        awd directs windows managers to do something useful; for example, to layout
        windows;
        
        awd works with any [ewmh][]-compatible x window managers, but is not a window
        manager itself; so there is no need to replace the current window manager to use
        awd;
        
        ## install
        
            pip install awd
        
        ## usage
        
        run in command line:
        
            awd [options]
        
        ## shortcuts
        
        optionally, you can bind `awd` to a keyboard shortcut. the binding method may
        be wm-specific. some notable examples are:
        
        -   in `compiz`, you can configure keyboard shortcuts with `ccsm` in menu item
            `general -> commands`.
        
        -   in a plain x window system, you can use `xbindkeys` to configure keyboard
            shortcuts. `xbindkeys` features a tool `xbindkeys_config` for easy gui
            configuration.
        
        for other window managers, please consult their manuals.
        
        ## troubleshooting
        
        ### enable debug mode
        
        enable debug mode to dump window information:
        
            awd --debug
        
        ### hide all desktop icons
        
        some file managers manage the desktop by adding a window containing icons. the
        desktop can be disabled with either of these two commands:
        
            dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/background/show-desktop-icons false
        
            gsettings set org.gnome.background show-desktop-icons false
        
        ### hide windows by names
        
        if there are windows that `awd` doesn't handle properly, they can be excluded:
        
            awd --exclude {name}
        
        window names matching `name` won't be handled by `awd`.
        
        multiple `--exclude` options are supported.
