        Notes:
            A Command represents an operation that needs to be executed on an entity (NSG, Gateway, ...) which requires little processing by VSD, but may result in a long activity on the external entity.  An example would be to trigger an action on VSD so that a Gateway download a new image.  VSDs handling of the request is limited to generating a message to be sent to the device on which the download process is expected.  The device then acts on the request and proceeds with the download...  That may be a long process.  The commands API is similar to the Jobs API with regards to triggering operations on objects.
