LattesLab: A Lattes CV Exploration Project
===========+++++++++++++++++++============

LattesLab is a Python package destined to aid on the data collection and
exploration associated to Lattes CV files.

It uses Data Science concepts associated with Python language libraries to
produce some data products such as:

- Extracting information from Lattes CVs and storing it on Data Frames for 
reuse;

- Extracting a nodes network from a given list of Lattes CVs;

- Evaluate the existance of mean publication profiles for a group of
researchers;

- Evaluate the most relevant terms on a group of Lattes CVs descriptions;
Creating a wordmap of these CVs.

It was created for a project on the author's Masters Degree program. I 
hope you find it useful.
