#Auto-Chomsky phrase generator

Chomsky sentence generator.

Chomsky is an aid to writing linguistic papers in the style
of the great master.  It is based on selected phrases taken
from actual books and articles written by Noam Chomsky.
Upon request, it assembles the phrases in the elegant
stylistic patterns that Chomsky is noted for.

To generate sentences of linguistic wisdom in a paragraph

For 1 sentence wrapped at 72 characters:
>>> chomsky()

For n sentences wrapped at 72 characters:
>>> chomsky(n)

For n sentence wrapped at x characters:
>>> chomsky(n, x)

The phrase database was converted directly from someone else's Lisp program:
