.. _beat_cmdline_introduction:

=========================
BEAT Command-line Client
=========================


This package provides a Python-based client for BEAT's web service or locally
installed repositories. It allows users to list, validate, edit, download and
upload objects from remote BEAT instances, as well as running BEAT experiments
locally. It also doubles as a Python-client API for packages that need to
implement more advanced functionality than this client (``beat``) provides.
