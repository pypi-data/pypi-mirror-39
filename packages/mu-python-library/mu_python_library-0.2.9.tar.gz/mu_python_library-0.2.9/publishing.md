# Publishing Project Mu Pip Python Library

The MuPythonLibrary is published as a pypi (pip) module.  The pip module is named __mu_python_library__.  Pypi allows for easy version management, dependency management, and sharing.

Publishing/releasing a new version is generally handled thru a server based build process but for completeness the process is documented here.
