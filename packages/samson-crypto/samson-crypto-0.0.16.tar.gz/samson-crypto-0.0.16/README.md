# Samson

Samson is a cryptanalysis and attack framework. The intent is to provide a way to quickly prototype and execute cryptographic and side-channel attacks.

## Installation
RHEL derivatives
```bash
sudo dnf -y install python3-devel gmp-devel redhat-rpm-config
pip3 install ipython
pip3 install samson-crypto
```


## Performance
Samson's primitives aren't the fastest nor were they meant to be. If you're concerned about performance, you have a couple of options:

* Use primitives from a faster library (e.g. pycrypto)
* Use PyPy instead of CPython

Since samson mostly calls Python, PyPy offers large speed-ups. However, `multiprocessing` doesn't work very well with PyPy. There seems to be a memory leak, and sometimes bytes are unpickled as strings. I recommend against running the RC4 prepend attack with PyPy as it uses `multiprocessing`. Additionally, the latest stable version of PyPy works with Python 3.5 while SHA3 was introduced in 3.6. samson's SHA3 will still work, but the tests will fail.
