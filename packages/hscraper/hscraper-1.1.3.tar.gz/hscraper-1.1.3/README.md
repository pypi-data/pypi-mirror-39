# hscraper
A web scraping tool to rip galleries from Ehentai, Danbooru, R34 and hitomi.la.

## **A HUGE NSFW WARNING:** None of these pages could be considered suitable for work nor school.

- I made this as both, practice and as an utilitarian tool for myself (lel).
- It works as a common CLI that lets you save galleries to your hard drive easily.
- It Supports Batch downloads from a 'txt' file with links (must specify number of pages too).
- Finally usable.
- It requires click, requests and beautiful soup 4 to work.
- Made in Python 3.

### Installation:
As easy as:
> pip install hscraper

*It'll also install dependencies if you don't have them already.*
