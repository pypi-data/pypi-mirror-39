Description: thoth-solver
        ============
        
        Dependency solver for the Thoth project.
        
        Project Scope
        =============
        
        The aim of this project is to answer a simple question - what packages will be installed (resolved by pip) for the provided stack?
        
        Imagine you have an application that has one dependency:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
          $ cat requirements.txt
          tensorflow
        
        
        This project will tell you how dependencies could be resolved:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
          thoth-solver -vvv pypi -r requirements.txt 
        
        The output can be found at `here <https://pastebin.com/bKLbcXe1>`_.
        
        Installation and Deployment
        ===========================
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
          git clone git@github.com:thoth-station/solver.git
          cd thoth-solver && export PYTHONPATH='.'
          ./thoth-solver --help
        
        
        This project is also released on
        `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/thoth-solver>`_, so the latest release can be
        installed via pip or Pipenv:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
          pipenv install thoth-solver
        
        
        Solver is run in Thoth to gather information about package dependencies. You
        can find deployment templates in the `openshift/` directory present in the
        root of this Git repository. The actual deployment is done using Ansible
        playbooks available in the
        `Thoth's core repository <https://github.com/thoth-station/core>`_.
