Description: A simple Jupyter kernel for PostgreSQL
        
        Install with `pip install git+https://github.com/bgschiller/postgres_kernel.git`
        
        To use, run one of:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            jupyter notebook
            # In the notebook interface, select PostgreSQL from the 'New' menu
            jupyter qtconsole --kernel postgres
            jupyter console --kernel postgres
        
        For details of how this works, see Jupyter's docs on `wrapper kernels
        <http://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wrapperkernels.html>`_.
        This is heavily based on `takluyver/bash_kernel
        <https://github.com/takluyver/bash_kernel>`_. Just look at our git log :)

        Todo
        ----
        
        - Get rid of this ShimWarning, "You should import from ipykernel or jupyter_client instead."
        - How do I make this pip-installable?

        - Catherine Devlin has an ipython magic that seems very full featured: `catherinedevlin/ipython-sql <https://github.com/catherinedevlin/ipython-sql>`_
        
        - As noted, this is based on `takluyver/bash_kernel <https://github.com/takluyver/bash_kernel>`_
