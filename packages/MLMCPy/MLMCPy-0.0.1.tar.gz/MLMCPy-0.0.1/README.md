# MLMCPy - **M**ulti-**L**evel **M**onte **C**arlo with **Py**thon

<a href='https://coveralls.io/github/lukemorrill/MLMCPy?branch=master'><img src='https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lukemorrill/MLMCPy/badge.svg?branch=master' alt='Coverage Status' /></a>

## General
MLMCPy is an open source implementation of the Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) method in Python.
It was developed with ease of use in mind.

## Dependencies
MLMCPy is intended for use with Python 2.7.

Required packages:
- numpy
- scipy

Optional packages:
- mpi4py (for using with mpirun)
- pytest (for running unit tests)

## Tests
Well over one hundred tests are included to thoroughly test MLMCPy. 

## Example usage

```python
import numpy as np
import sys

from MLMCPy.input import RandomInput
from MLMCPy.mlmc import MLMCSimulator

# Add path for example SpringMassModel to sys path.
sys.path.append('./examples/spring_mass/from_model/spring_mass')
import SpringMassModel

'''
This script demonstrates MLMCPy for simulating a spring-mass system with a 
random spring stiffness to estimate the expected value of the maximum 
displacement using multi-level Monte Carlo. Here, we use Model and RandomInput
objects with functional forms as inputs to MLMCPy. See the
/examples/spring_mass/from_data/ for an example of using precomputed data
in files as inputs.
'''

# Step 1 - Define random variable for spring stiffness:
# Need to provide a sampleable function to create RandomInput instance in MLMCPy
def beta_distribution(shift, scale, alpha, beta, size):

    return shift + scale*np.random.beta(alpha, beta, size)

stiffness_distribution = RandomInput(distribution_function=beta_distribution,
                                     shift=1.0, scale=2.5, alpha=3., beta=2.)

# Step 2 - Initialize spring-mass models. Here using three levels with MLMC.
# defined by different time steps
model_level1 = SpringMassModel(mass=1.5, time_step=1.0)
model_level2 = SpringMassModel(mass=1.5, time_step=0.1)
model_level3 = SpringMassModel(mass=1.5, time_step=0.01)

models = [model_level1, model_level2, model_level3]

# Step 3 - Initialize MLMC & predict max displacement to specified error.

mlmc_simulator = MLMCSimulator(stiffness_distribution, models)

[estimates, sample_sizes, variances] = \
    mlmc_simulator.simulate(epsilon=1e-1,
                            initial_sample_sizes=100,
                            verbose=True)
