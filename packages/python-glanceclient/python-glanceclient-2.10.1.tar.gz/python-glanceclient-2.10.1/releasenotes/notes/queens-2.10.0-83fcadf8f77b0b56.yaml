    This release of python-glanceclient syncs up with Queens release of Glance
    API service, including critical bugfixes to client behaviour against the
    new Interoperable Image Import feature.
features:
  - |
    Support for Interoperable Image Import 'web-download' import method.
issues:
  - |
    Help texts for some properties has possibly outdated links. Please do
    refer to the documentation of the deployment while we do find a way how to
    document these references in a way that they do not point user to false
    information.
critical:
  - |
    Client commands "image-create-via-import" and "image-import" have aligned
    to the Glance common principles of failing early. This means that client
    does determine if the call would fail for sure before taking any create
    actions and thus minimizes the clutter created on the service that the
    user or admin would potentially need to take action on.
fixes:
  - |
    The following are some highlights of bugfixes included in this release.
