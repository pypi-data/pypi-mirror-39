============================
Infor Connector Account Move
============================

This module allows you to push the accounting entries of specific journals to 
Infor using the Process verb and a BOD file such as this one: 
`SunJournal_sample.xml.txt <https://github.com/OCA/connector-infor/files/1875843/SunJournal_sample.xml.txt>`_

Configuration
=============

* Go to Settings > Connectors > Infor Backends

Create a new backend
--------------------

* Set the type of synchronization for now only 'File' is implemented.
* Select where the files will be written by creating a 'File Backend', local file system or sftp.
* Set the message headers fields.

Set the journals to synchronize
-------------------------------

* Select the journals you want to sync and specify for each one
  * the frequency of the sync
  * if journal entries should be summarized (account moves are grouped by account id)
  * the "infor id" on the journals
* Make sure the account codes match between Odoo and Infor charts of accounts

Add custom fields
-----------------

Custom fields are added to each JournalEntryLine they can be of two different data types :

Static fields are added with a the predefined defualt value.

Dynamic fields are computed in the record fields hierarchy based on the field name 'field'.
If starting with 'object.' the account.move.line record will be used as a base.
If starting by 'backend.' then the infor.backend record is used.
If the field can not be resolved the data in 'default_value' will be used instead.

Set up partners
--------------------

Set the "Internal Reference" of each Odoo partner with their Infor ID
