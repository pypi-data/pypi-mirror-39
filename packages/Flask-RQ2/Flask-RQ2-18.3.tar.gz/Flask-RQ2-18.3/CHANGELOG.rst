https://img.shields.io/badge/calver-YY.0M.MICRO-22bfda.svg

Flask-RQ2 follows the `CalVer <http://calver.org/>`_ version specification
in the form of::

  YY.MINOR[.MICRO]

E.g.::

  16.1.1

The ``MINOR`` number is **not** the month of the year. The ``MICRO`` number
is a patch level for ``YY.MINOR`` releases and must *not* be specified for
inital ``MINOR`` releases such as ``18.0`` or ``19.2``.

.. snip

18.3 (2018-12-20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **IMPORTANT!** Reqires redis-py >= 3.0 since RQ and rq-scheduler have
  switched to that requirement. Please upgrade as soon as possible.

18.2.2 (2018-12-20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Last release to support redis-py < 3.0.0!** Fixes version incompatibility
  with rq-scheduler. Requires rq-scheduler < 0.9.0.

18.2, 18.2.1 (2018-11-29)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Requires redis-py < 3.0.0 as long as RQ hasn't been made compatible to
  that version. Please don't update redis-py to 3.x yet, it will break
  using RQ.

  More infos:

  - https://github.com/rq/rq/issues/1014
  - https://github.com/rq/Flask-RQ2/issues/75

- Require rq < 0.13.0 to cater to a possible Redis 3.0.0 compatible version.

18.1 (2018-09-19)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Requires rq >= 0.12.0 and rq-scheduler >= 0.8.3 now.

- Fixes imcompatibility with the new rq 0.12.0 release with which the
  ``flask rq worker`` command would raise an error because of changes
  in handling of the ``worker_ttl`` parameter defaults.

- Added support for Python 3.7. Since 'async' is a keyword in Python 3.7,
  `RQ(async=True)` has been changed to `RQ(is_async=True)`. The `async`
  keyword argument will still work, but raises a `DeprecationWarning`.

- Documentation fixes.

18.0 (2018-03-02)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The project has been moved to the official RQ GitHub organization!

  New URL: https://github.com/rq/flask-rq2

- Stop monkey-patching the scheduler module since rq-scheduler gained the
  ability to use custom job classes.

  **Requires rq-scheduler 0.8.2 or higher.**

- Adds `depends_on`, `at_front`, `meta` and `description` parameters to job
  decorator.

  **Requires rq==0.10.0 or higher.**

- Minor fixes for test infrastructure.

17.2 (2017-12-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Allow dynamically setting timeout, result TTL and job TTL and other
  parameters when enqueuing, scheduling or adding as a cron job.

17.1 (2017-12-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Require Flask >= 0.10, but it's recommended to use at least 0.11.

- Require rq 0.8.0 or later and rq-scheduler 0.7.0 or later.

- Require setting ``FLASK_APP`` environment variable to load Flask app
  during job performing.

- Add ``RQ_SCHEDULER_CLASS``, ``RQ_WORKER_CLASS``, ``RQ_JOB_CLASS`` and
  ``RQ_QUEUE_CLASS`` as configuration values.

- Add support for rq-scheduler's ``--burst`` option to automatically quit
  after all work is done.

- Drop support for Flask-Script in favor of native Flask CLI support
  (or via Flask-CLI app for Flask < 0.11).

- Drop support for Python 3.4.

- Allow setting the queue dynamically when enqueuing, scheduling or adding
  as a cron job.

- Handle the result_ttl and queue_name job overrides better.

- Actually respect the ``RQ_SCHEDULER_INTERVAL`` config value.

- Move ``flask_rq2.helpers`` module to ``flask_rq2.functions``.

- Use a central Redis client and require app initialization before connecting.
  You'll have to run ``RQ.init_app`` **before** you can queue or schedule
  a job from now on.

17.0 (2017-02-15)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Pin the rq version Flask-RQ2 depends on to >=0.6.0,<0.7.0 for now.
  A bigger refactor will follow shortly that fixes those problems better.

- Allow overriding the `default_timeout` in case of using the
  factory pattern.

- Run tests on Python 3.6.

16.1.1 (2016-09-08)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix typos in docs.

16.1 (2016-09-08)
