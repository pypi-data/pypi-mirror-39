SeleniumFramework
=================

Well, when i looked into my previous codes, I found 6 years back (2013) when I just joined Autodesk, I wrote a Selenium Framework which was used by several teams within Autodesk.

Now 6 years passed and I already left Autodesk, maybe it's time to share to Github, lol.

This framework provides a way to code Selenium Automation with Layers instead of wrting un-resuable and un-readable codes. 
Suggested layers are:
 - Pages: define elements and pages
 - Actions: define test actions using web elements defined in "pages"
 - Test Cases: combination of actions

I made some tests these days and prooved these codes can be executed from Mac using Python 3.6.

If I have time, i will work on the follwoing:
 - HTML reports
 - make it more compatible with Firefox on Windows or Linux
 - test headless

Don't laugh at me if codes looks ugly for you, i wrote it 6 years ago, lol
