## Introduction
Calculus, according to the American mathematician Michael Spivak in his noted textbook, is fundamentally the study of "infinitesimal change." An infinitesimal change, according to Johann Bernoulli as Spivak quotes, is so tiny that "if a quantity is increased or decreased by an infinitesimal, then that quantity is neither increased nor decreased." The study of these infinitesimal changes is the study of relationships of change, not the computation of change itself. The derivative is canonically found as function of a limit of a point as it approaches 0 -- we care about knowing the relationship of change, not the computation of change itself.

One incredibly important application of the derivative is varieties of optimization problems. Machines are able to traverse gradients iteratively through calculations of derivatives. However, in machine learning applications, it is possible to have millions of parameters for a given neural net and this would imply a combinatorially onerous number of derivatives to compute analytically. A numerical Newton's method approach (iteratively calculating through guesses of a limit) is likewise not a wise alternative because even for "very small"
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h"/>, the end result can be orders of magnitude off in error relative to machine precision.

So, one might think that a career in ML thus requires an extensive calculus background, but, Ryan P Adams, formerly of Twitter (and Harvard IACS), now of Princeton CS, describes automatic differentiation as ["getting rid of the math that gets in the way of solving a [ML] problem."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq2gPzlrM0g) What we ultimately care about is tuning the hyperparameters of a machine learning algorithm, so if we can get a machine to do this for us, that is ultimately what we care about. What is implemented in this package is automatic differentiation which allows us to calculate derivatives of complex functions to machine precision 'without the math getting in the way.'

## Background
The most important calculus derivative rule for automatic differentiation is the multivariate chain rule.

The basic chain rule states that the derivative of a composition of functions is:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(f&space;\circ&space;g)^{'}&space;=&space;(f^{'}&space;\circ&space;g)&space;\cdot&space;g^'" title="(f \circ g)^{'} = (f^{'} \circ g) \cdot g^'" />

That is, the derivative is a function of the incremental change in the outer function applied to the inner function, multiplied by the change in the inner function.

In the multivariate case, we can apply the chain rule as well as the rule of total differentiation. For instance, if we have a simple equation:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y&space;=&space;u&space;\cdot&space;v" title="y = u \cdot v" />

Then,

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y&space;=&space;f(u,v)" title="y = f(u,v)" />

The partial derivatives:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\frac{\partial&space;y}{\partial&space;u}&space;=&space;v" title="\frac{\partial y}{\partial u} = v" />

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\frac{\partial&space;y}{\partial&space;v}&space;=&space;u" title="\frac{\partial y}{\partial v} = u" />

The total variation of y depends on both the variations in u, v and thus,

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?dy&space;=&space;\frac{\partial&space;y}{\partial&space;u}&space;du&space;&plus;&space;\frac{\partial&space;y}{\partial&space;v}&space;dv" title="dy = \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} du + \frac{\partial y}{\partial v} dv" />

What this trivial example illustrates is that the derivative of a multivariate function is ultimately the addition of the partial derivatives and computations of its component variables. If a machine can compute any given sub-function as well as the partial derivative between any sub-functions, then the machine need only add-up the product of a function and its derivatives to calculate the total derivative.

[An intuitive way of understanding automatic differentiation is to think of any complicated function as ultimately a a graph of composite functions.](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/) Each node is a primitive operation -- one in which the derivative is readily known -- and the edges on this graph -- the relationship of change between any two variables -- are partial derivatives. The sum of the paths between any two nodes is thus the partial derivative between those two functions (this a graph restatement of the total derivative via the chain rule).

### Forward Mode

Forward mode automatic differentiation thus begins at an input to a graph and sums the source paths. The below diagrams (from Christopher Olah's blog) provide an intuition for this process. The relationship between three variables (X, Y, Z) is defined by a number of paths (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\alpha,&space;\beta,&space;\gamma,&space;\delta,&space;\epsilon&space;,\zeta" title="\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, \epsilon ,\zeta" />). Forward mode begins with a seed of 1, and then in each node derivative is the product of the sum of the previous steps.

![](images/chain-def-greek.png)

![](images/chain-forward-greek.png)

Consequently, provided that within each node there is an elementary function, the machine can track the derivative through the computational graph.

There is one last piece of the puzzle: dual numbers which extend the reals by restating each real as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x&space;&plus;&space;\epsilon" title="x + \epsilon" />, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\epsilon^2&space;=&space;0" title="epsilon^2 = 0" />. Symbolic evaluation, within a machine, can quickly become computational untenable because the machine must hold in memory variables and their derivatives in the successive expansions of the rules of calculus. Dual numbers allow us to track the derivative of even a complicated function, as a kind of data structure that caries both the derivative and the primal of a number.

In our chain rule equation, there are two pieces to the computation: the derivative of the outer function applied to the inner function and that value multiplied by the derivative of the inner function. This means that the full symbolic representation of an incredibly complicated function can grow to exponentially many terms. However, dual numbers allow us to parse that symbolic representation in bitesized pieces that can be analytically computed. [The reason for this is the Taylor series expansion of a function](http://jliszka.github.io/2013/10/24/exact-numeric-nth-derivatives.html):

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(x&plus;p)&space;=&space;f(x)&space;&plus;f'(x)p&space;&plus;&space;\frac{f''(x)p^2}{2!}&space;&plus;&space;\frac{f^{(3)}(x)p^3}{3!}" title="f(x+p) = f(x) +f'(x)p + \frac{f''(x)p^2}{2!} + \frac{f^{(3)}(x)p^3}{3!}" />

When one evaluates <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(x&space;&plus;&space;\epsilon)" title="f(x + \epsilon)" />, given that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\epsilon^2&space;=&space;0" title="\epsilon^2 = 0" />, then all the higher order terms drop out (they are 0) and one is left with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(x)&space;&plus;f'(x)\epsilon" title="f(x) +f'(x)\epsilon" />

### Reverse Mode

**INSERT TEXT HERE**

To recap: automatic differentiation is an algorithmic means of computing complicated derivatives by parsing those functions as a graph structures to be traversed. Dual numbers are used as a sort of mathematical data structure which allows the machine to analytically compute the derivative at any given node. It is superior to analytic or symbolic differentiation because it is actually computationally feasible on modern machines! And it is superior to numerical methods because automatic differentiation is far more accurate (it achieves machine precision).

## How to Use Dotua

### How to Install
To install our package, one can simply use pip install like so:

```bash
$ pip install Dotua
```

### Import and Usage Examples
#### Forward Mode
In order to instantiate a forward mode auto-differentiation object from our package, the user shall first import the AutoDiff function from the Dotua library as such:

```py
from Dotua.autodiff import AutoDiff as ad
```

The general workflow for the user is as follows:
- Instantiate all variables as AutoDiff objects.
- Input these variables into operators from the **Operator** class within the
Dotua library to create more complex expressions that propagate the derivative
using forward mode automatic differentiation.

The **AutoDiff** class is the core constructor for all variables in the function
that are to be differentiated. There are two options for instantiating
variables: **Scalar** and **Vector**, generated with *create_scalar()* and *create_vector()* respectively. **Scalar** variables have a single value per
variable, while **Vector** variables can have multiple associated values. The
general schematic for how the user shall instantiate **AutoDiff** objects is
outlined below:

1. Create either a **Scalar** or **Vector AutoDiff** object to generate seed
variables to later build the function to be differentiated. The initialization
works as follows:

```python
x, y = ad.create_scalar(vals = [1, 2])
z = ad.create_vector(vals = [1, 2, 3])
```

2. Next, the user shall import the **Operator** class and pass in these
variables into elementary functions as follows:

```python
from Dotua.operator import Operator as op
result = op.sin(x * y)
results = op.sin(z)
```

Simple operators, such as sums and products, can be used normally:
```python
result = 6 * x
results = z + 4
```

3. Finally, (as a continuation of the previous example), the user may access the value and derivative of a function using the *eval()* and *partial()* methods:

```python
print(result.eval())  # 6
print(result.partial(x))  # 6
print(result.partial(y))  # 0
```
For **Scalar** variables, *result.eval()* will return the value of the function,
while *result.partial(v)* will return the partial derivative with respect to any variable, *v*. For **Vector** variables, *results.eval()* returns a list of tuples
(value, jacobian), with one tuple for each function in the vector. The jacobian is a dictionary that represents the 
derivative of that element with respect to all of the elements in the vector.

#### Reverse Mode

The initialization for reverse mode variables is very similar to forward mode.
The only difference is that there is an "r" in front of the module names. It is, however, important to note that there is no vector equivalent for the reverse
mode implementation. Additionally, for the initialization of reverse mode
variables, the user must instatiate an initializer object.  This differs
from the forward mode variables which can be initialized using statimethods.
One can initialize a reverse mode scalar object as follows:

```python
from Dotua.rautodiff import rAutoDiff as rad
rad_initializer = rad()
x, y, z = rad_initializer.create_rscalar([1, 2, 3])
```

In reverse mode, when the user calls the gradient function, they must specify
the variable they would like to differentiate with respect to. This time, the
gradient function simple returns a numeric constant. An example of this is shown
below:

```python
f = x + y + z
f_gradx = rad_initializer.partial(f, x)  # f_gradx = 1
```

### Examples
There are several files in the top level directory of the Dotua package that demonstrate the usage of the package. The first is a file called "driver.py" which provides further examples on how the Dotua package can be used, and also serves
as a comparison to NumPy functions to prove its efficacy.

The second file is an interactive jupyter notebook which contains an example use
case where the Dotua package performs well, namely, the Newton-Raphson method for approximating roots of functions. This notebook is titled "newton_demo.ipynb" and resides in "examples" folder in the top level directory of the package. The output of this demo is reproduced here for convenience:

A third file is an example of how our reverse mode autodifferentiation package can be used to do backpropagation in a neural network. The file is called...

### Modules

#### Dotua/
The **Dotua** module contains the codes for forward mode implementation and reverse mode implementation.

It contains *AutoDiff* (autodiff.py), which is the driver of the forward mode autodifferentiation. The driver helps the users with getting access to the *Node* superclass (node.py) and associated subclasses (i.e., *Vector* (vector.py) and *Scalar* (scalar.py)), and the *Operator* class (operator.py).

It also contains *rAutoDiff* (rautodiff.py), which is the driver of the reverse mode autodifferentiation. The driver helps the users with getting access to the *rScalar* class (rscalar.py) and the *rOperator* class (roperator.py).

#### examples/
The **Examples** module will contain Python files with documented use cases of the library. Potential examples include an implementation of Newton’s Method for approximating the roots of a non-linear function and a module which computes local extrema and an implementation of Neural Network for prediction problems.

#### tests/
The **Tests** module contains the project’s testing suite and is formatted according to the pytest requirements for automatic test discovery.

### Testing

#### Overview
The majority of the testing in Dotua's test suite consists of unit testing.
The aim is to verify the correctness of the application with thorough unit
testing of all simple usages of the forward and reverse modes
of automatic differentiation. Essentially, this involves validating that our application produces correct calculations (evaluations and derivatives) for all elementary functions. Additionally, a range of more complex unit testing covers advanced scenarios such as functions with multidimensional domains and codomains
(for forward mode) as well as functions with inherent complexity generated from
the composition of elementary functions.

#### Test Automation
Dotua uses continuous integration testing through **Travis CI** to perform
automated, machine independent testing. Additionally, Dotua uses **Coveralls**
to validate the high code coverage of our testing suite (currently 100%).
Travis CI and Coveralls badges are embedded into the project README to provide transparency for users interacting with our project through GitHub.

#### Installation
To install our package, one can simply use **pip install** like so:

```bash
$ pip install Dotua
```

#### User Verification
The entire Dotua test suite is included in the project distribution.  Thus,
users are able to verify correctness for themselves using pytest after
installing the Dotua package.

### Distribution

#### Licensing
Dotua is distributed under the GNU GPLv3 license to allow free “as is” usage
while requiring all extensions to remain open source.


## Implementation

The purpose of the Dotua library is to perform automatic differentation
on user defined functions, where the domain and codomain may be single- or
multi-dimensional (*n.b. this library provides support for both the forward
and reverse modes of automatic differentation, but for the reverse mode only
functions with single-dimensional codomains are supported*).  At a high level,
Dotua serves as a partial replacement for NumPy in the sense that
Dotua provides methods for many of the mathematical functions
(e.g., trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, hyperbolic, etc.) that NumPy
implements; however, while the NumPy versions of these methods can only provide function evaluation, the Dotua equivalents provide both evaluation and differentiation.

To achieve this, the Dotua library implements the following abstract
ideas:
  1. Allowing users to be as expressive as they would like to be by providing
     our own versions of binary and unary operators.
  2. Forward AD: keeping track of the value and derivative of user defined
     expressions and functions.
  3. Reverse AD: constructing a computational graph from user defined functions
     that can be used to quickly compute gradients.

With these goals in mind, the Dotua forward mode implementation relies on
the **Nodes** modules and the **Operator** class and allows user interface
through the **AutoDiff** class which serves as a **Node** factory for initializing instances of *Scalar* and *Vector*.  Analogously, the Dotua reverse mode
implementation relies on the **Nodes** module and the **rOperator** class
and facilitates user interface through the **rAutoDiff** class which serves as a
factory for initializing instances of *rScalar*.

## Nodes
The **Nodes** module contains a *Node* superclass with the following basic design:

```python
class Node():
    def eval(self):
        '''
        For the Scalar and Vector subclasses, this function returns the node's
        value as well as its derivative, both of which are guaranteed to be
        up to date by the class' operator overloads.

        Returns (self._val, self._jacobian)
        '''
        raise NotImplementedError

    def __add__(self, other):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def __radd__(self, other):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def __mul__(self, other):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def __rmul__(self, other):
        raise NotImplementedError

    ... # Additional operator overloads
```

Essentially, the role of the *Node* class (which in abstract terms is meant to
represent a node in the computational graph underlying forward mode automatic differentiation of user defined expressions) is to serve as an interface for two
other classes in the **Nodes** package: *Scalar* and *Vector*.  Each of these subclasses implements the required operator overloading as necessary for scalar
and vector functions respectively (i.e., addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, power, etc.). This logic is separated into two separate classes to
provide increased organization for higher dimensional functions and to allow
class methods to use assumptions of specific properties of scalars and vectors
to reduce implementation complexity.

Both the *Scalar* class and the *Vector* class have *_val* and *_jacobian* class attributes which allow for forward automatic differentiation by keeping track of
each node's value and derivative.

The **Nodes** package also contains the *rScalar* class which can be used for
reverse mode automatic differentiation.  However, it should be noted that
*rScalar* does not inherit from or fulfill the *Node* class abstract interface.

### Scalar
The *Scalar* class is used for user defined one-dimensional variables.
Specifically, users can define functions of scalar variables (i.e., functions
defined over multiple scalar variables with a one-dimensional codomain) using
instances of *Scalar* in order to simultaneously calculate the function value
and first derivative at a pre-chosen point of evaluation using forward mode
automatic differentiation. Objects of the *Scalar* class are initialized with a
value (i.e., the point of evaluation) which is stored in the class attribute **self._val** (n.b., as the single underscore suggests, this attribute should
not be directly accessed or modified by the user).  Additionally, *Scalar*
objects – which could be either individual scalar variables or expressions of
scalar variables – keep track of their own derivatives in the class attribute **self._jacobian**. This derivative is implemented as a dictionary with *Scalar* objects serving as the keys and real numbers as values.  Note that each *Scalar* object's **_jacobian** attribute has an entry for all scalar variables which the
object might interact with (see AutoDiff Initializer section for more
information).

Users interact with *Scalar* objects in two ways:
1. **eval(self)**: This method allows users to obtain the value and derivative
for a *Scalar* object at the point of evaluation defined when the user first
initialized their *Scalar* objects.  Specifically, this method returns a tuple
of **self._val** and **self._jacobian**.
2. **partial(self, var)**: This method allows users to obtain a partial
derivative of the given *Scalar* object with respect to **var**.  If **self**
is one of the *Scalar* objects directly initialized by the user (see AutoDiff Initializer section), then **partial()** returns 1 if **var == self** and 0
otherwise.  If **self** is a *Scalar* object formed by an expression of other
*Scalar* objects (e.g., **self = Scalar(1) + Scalar(2)**), then this method returns the correct partial
derivative of **self** with respect to **var**.

Note that these are the only methods that users should be calling for *Scalar*
objects and that users should not be directly accessing any of the object's
class attributes.

*Scalar* objects support left- and right-sided addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, exponentiation, and negation.

### rScalar

The *rScalar* class is the reverse mode automatic differentiation analog of
the *Scalar* class.  That is to say, *rScalar* is used for user defined
one-dimensional variables with which users can define scalar functions (i.e.,
functions defined over multiple scalar variables with a one-dimensional
codomain) in order to calculate the function value and later easily determine
the function's gradient reverse mode automatic differentiation (see the
rAutoDiff Initializer section for more details).  Objects of the *rScalar*
class are initialized with a value (i.e., the point of evaluation) which is
stored in the class attribute **self._val** (n.b., as the
single underscore suggests, this attribute should not be directly accessed or
modified by the user).  Additionally, *rScalar* objects – which could be either individual scalar variables or expressions of scalar variables – explicitly
construct the computational graph used in automatic differentiation in the class
attribute **self.parents()**.  This attribute represents the computational graph
as a list of tuples of the form (parent, value) where parent is an *rScalar*
object and value is the derivative of the function represented by parent
with respect to the variable represented by the *rScalar* *self*.  This list
is constructed implicitly through operator overloading whenever the user
defines functions using *rScalar* objects.

Users interact with *Scalar* objects in one way:
1. **eval(self)**: This method allows users to obtain the value
for an *rScalar* object at the point of evaluation defined when the user first
initialized the *rScalar* object.  Specifically, this method returns the value
of the attribute **self._val**.

Note that this is the only method that users should be calling for *rScalar*
objects and that users should not be directly accessing any of the object's
class attributes.  While the *rScalar* class contains a *gradient()* method,
this method is for internal use only.  Users should only be obtaining the
derivatives of functions represented by *rScalar* objects through the
*partial()* method provided in the *rAutoDiff* initializer class (see rAutoDiff
Initializer section for more details).

*rScalar* objects support left- and right-sided addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, exponentiation, and negation.


### Vector
*Vector* is a subclass of *Node*. Every vector variable consists of a 1-d numpy array to store the values and a 2-d numpy array to store the jacobian matrix.
User can use index to acess specific element in a *Vector* instance. And operations between elements in the same vector instance and operations between vectors are implemented by overloading the operators of the class.
For *Vector* class, the elementary functions such as exponential functions and trig functions have not been implemented in the operator class yet. (But basic operations such as '+', '-', '*', '/', '**' are supported for *Vector* class now.)

## AutoDiff Initializer

The AutoDiff class functions as a **Node** factory, allowing the user to initialize
variables for the sake of constructing arbitray functions.  Because the **Node**
class serves only as an interface for the *Scalar* and *Vector* classes, users
should not instantiate objects of the *Node* class directly.  Thus, we
define the *AutoDiff* class in the following way to allow users to initialize
*Scalar* and *Vector* variables:

```Python
from Dotua.nodes.scalar import Scalar
from Dotua.nodes.vector import Vector

class AutoDiff():
    @staticmethod
    def create_scalar(vals):
        '''
        @vals denotes the evaluation points of variables for which the user
        would like to create Scalar variables.  If @vals is a list,
        the function returns a list of Scalar variables with @vals
        values.  If @vals is a single value, the user receives a single Scalar
        variable (not as a list).  This function also initializes the jacobians
        of all variables allocated.
        '''
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def create_vector(vals):
        '''
        The idea is similar to create_scalar.
        This will allow the user to create vectors and specify initial
        values for the elements of the vectors.
        '''
        pass
```

Using the *create_scalar* and *create_vector* methods, users are able to
initialize variables for use in constructing arbitrary functions.  Additionally,
users are able to specify initial values for these variables.  Creating variables
in this way will ensure that users are able to use the Dotua defined
operators to both evaluate functions and compute their derivatives.

### Variable Universes

The implementaiton of the AutoDiff library makes the following assumption:
for each environment in which the user uses autodifferentiable variables
(i.e., *Scalar* and *Vector* objects), the user initializes all such variables
with a single call to **create_scalar** or **create_vector**.  This assumption
allows *Scalar* and *Vector* objects to fully initialize their jacobians before
being used by the user.  This greatly reduces implementation complexity.

This design choice should not restrict users in their construction of arbitrary
functions for the reason that in order to define a function, the user must
know how many primitive scalar variables they need to use in advance.  Realize
that this does not mean that a user is prevented from defining new Python
variables as functions of previously created *Scalar* objects, but only that a
user, in defining a mathematical function **f(x, y, z)** must initialize
**x, y, and z** with a single call to **create_scalar**.  It is perfectly
acceptable that in the definition of **f(x, y, z)** a Python variable such as
**a = x + y** is created. The user is guaranteed that **a.eval()** and
**a.partial(x), a.partial(y), and a.partial(z)** are all well defined and correct because **a** in this case is an instance of *Scalar*; however, it is not a
"primitive" scalar variable and thus the user could not take a partial
derivative with respect to **a**.

## rAutoDiff Initializer

The rAutoDiff class functions as an **rScalar** factory, allowing the user to
initialize variables for the sake of constructing arbitray functions of which
they want to later determine the derivative using reverse mode automatic
differentiation.  Because the same *rScalar* variables can be used to define
multiple functions, users must instantiate an rAutoDiff object to manage
the *rScalar* objects they create and calcuate the gradients of different
functions of the same variables.  Thus, we define the *rAutoDiff* class in the following ways:

```Python
from Dotua.nodes.rscalar import rScalar

class rAutoDiff():
    def __init__(self):
        self.func = None
        self.universe = []

    def create_rscalar(vals):
        '''
        @vals denotes the evaluation points of variables for which the user
        would like to create rScalar variables.  If @vals is a list,
        the function returns a list of rScalar variables with @vals
        values.  If @vals is a single value, the user receives a single rScalar
        variable (not as a list).  This function also adds the new rScalar
        object(s) to the _universe of the rAutoDiff object.
        '''
        pass

    def partial(self, func, var):
        '''
        This method allows users to calculate the derivative of @func the
        function of rScalar objects with respect to the variable represented
        by the rScalar @var.  This method also sets the self.func attribute
        of the rAutoDiff object to the given @func.
        '''
        pass

    def _reset_universe(self, var):
        '''
        This method is for internal use only.  When a user calls partial(),
        the rAutoDiff object will first call _reset_universe() to reset then
        grad_val variables of the necessary rScalar objects before
        calculating the desired derivative.
        '''
        pass
```

By instantiating an *rAutoDiff* object and using the *create_rscalar* method,
users are able to initialize varibales for use in constructing arbitrary
functions. Additionally, users are able to specify initial values for these
variables. Creating variables in this way will ensure that users are able to
use the Dotua defined operators to both evaluate functions and compute their
derivatives.  Furhtermore, using the *partial* method, users are able to
determine the derivative of their constructed function with respect to
a specified *rScalar* variable.

## Operator

The *Operator* class defines static methods for elementary mathematical
functions and operators (specifically those that cannot be overloaded in the
*Scalar* and *Vector* classes) that can be called by users in constructing arbitrary functions.  The *Operator* class will import the Nodes module in order to
return new *Scalar* or *Vector* variables as appropriate.  The design of the
*Operator* class is as follows:

```Python
import numpy as np
from Dotua.nodes.scalar import Scalar

class Operator():
    @staticmethod
    def sin(x):
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def cos(x):
        pass

    ... # Other elementary functions
```

For each method defined in the *Operator* class, our implementation uses
ducktyping to return the necessary object.  If user passes a *Scalar* object
to one of the methods then a new *Scalar* object is returned to the user
with the correct value and jacobian.  On the other hand, if the user passes
a Python numeric type, then the method returns the evaluation of the
corresponding NumPy method on the given argument
(e.g., **op.sin(1) = np.sin(1)**).

## rOperator

Similarly, the *rOperator* class defines static methods for elementary mathematical
functions and operators (specifically those that cannot be overloaded in the
*rScalar* class) that can be called by users in constructing arbitrary functions.  The *rOperator* class only imports the
rScalar class in order to return new *rScalar* variables as appropriate.  The design of the
*rOperator* class is as follows:

```Python
import numpy as np
from Dotua.nodes.rscalar import rScalar

class rOperator():
    @staticmethod
    def sin(x):
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def cos(x):
        pass

    ... # Other elementary functions
```

Once again, for each method defined in the *rOperator* class, our implementation uses
ducktyping to return the necessary object.  If user passes an *rScalar* object
to one of the methods, then a new *rScalar* object is returned to the user
with the correct value and parent/child link.  On the other hand, if the user passes
a Python numeric type, then the method returns the evaluation of the
corresponding NumPy method on the given argument
(e.g., **rop.sin(1) = np.sin(1)**).

<!-- ## A Note on Reverse Mode

Given the similarities between the forward and reverse modes of automatic
differentiation, it is possible to provide the functionality of both techniques
with a "mixed mode" implementation.  Functionality for forward and reverse
automatic differentiation has been purposefully separated in the Dotua
library for performance considerations.  Specifically, the performance of
reverse mode is likely to suffer in such an implementation because of the
overhead involved in ...  Thus, by separating the imlpementations of forward
and reverse automatic differentiation, Dotua avoids these performance
issues. -->

## A Note on Comparisons

It is important to note that the Dotua library intentionally does not overload
comparison operators for its variables classs (i.e., *Scalar*, *rScalar*, and
*Vector*).  Users should only use the the equality and inequality operators == and !=
to determine object equivalence.  For users wishing to perform comparisons on
the values of functions or variables composes of *Scalar*, *rScalar*, or
*Vector* variables with the values of functions or variables of the same type,
they can do so in the following manner:

### Scalar Comparisons

The values of *Scalar* variables should be compared by first obtaining the
*Scalar* object's value with a call to **eval()** and then performing any
desired numeric comparison on the first object in the tuple returned using the
standard comparison operators for numeric types in Python.  The derivatives of functions of *Scalar* variables can be compared as any other dictionaries
are compared in Python.

### rScalar Comparisons

The values of *rScalar* variables should be compared by first obtaining the
*Scalar* object's value with a call to **eval()** and then performing any
desired numeric comparison on the value returned using the
standard comparison operators for numeric types in Python.  Users can compare
the derivatives of functions defined using rScalars by using the rAutoDiff
partial method to form any desired gradient and then performing comparisons
using the standard numeric comparison operators.

### Vector Comparisons


## External Depencies

Dotua restricts dependencies on third-party libraries to the necessary
minimum. Thus, the only external dependencies are NumPy, pytest, and pytest-cov.
NumPy is used as necessary within the library for mathematical computation (e.g., trigonometric functions).  Additionally, pytest and pytest-cov are used to
perform unit testing and coverage analysis of such testing.
