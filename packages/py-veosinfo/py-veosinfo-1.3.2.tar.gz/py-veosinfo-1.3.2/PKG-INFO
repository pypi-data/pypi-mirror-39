Description: Python bindings to libveosinfo that provides various details
        on the SX-Aurora Vector Engines located in the current host:
         - lists VEs in the system and their state
         - information in the VE architecture
         - information on caches, frequencies of each VE core
         - load and memory statistics of VEs
         - information on processes running on the VEs
         - fan, temperature, voltage of VEs
         - various statistical infos
         - a mechanism to read VE register values of own processes
        
        The tool veperf can be used to periodically display performance metrics of
        the own VE processes.
        
        NOTE: veperf can trigger a bug in VEOS that leads very rarely to a lock-up
        of one of the processes who's performance is monitored. This issue will be
        fixed in the official VEOS 2.0 or later and is fixed in the inofficial release
