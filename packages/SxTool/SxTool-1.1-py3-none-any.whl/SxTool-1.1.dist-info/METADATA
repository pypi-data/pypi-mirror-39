SxTool 
======

SxTool is a very simple tool to work with dump files in ascii
format, like S19, S28 and S37 formats.
You can find specifications of those format at the following address:
https://www.sbprojects.net/knowledge/fileformats/motorola.php

The tool let you perform advanced operation on the file, while 
maintaining checksum, address and data consistency:

- add lines, delete lines, split lines, merge lines
- adjust address, change data, verify or recalculate checksum
- flip the data bits, or XOR the data  content

It is released under GPL license.

It was developed internally in a now defunct company. I am
making it available to the public after a bit of clean-up and upgrade.

SxTool was initially developed by Anthony Portier, Nicolas Chesné,
Philippe Fremy and Gaël Pouger.

Bug reports, improvement requests or praise should be managed on the
GitHub repository https://github.com/bluebird75/sxtool or by email 
to phil.fremy at free.fr .
