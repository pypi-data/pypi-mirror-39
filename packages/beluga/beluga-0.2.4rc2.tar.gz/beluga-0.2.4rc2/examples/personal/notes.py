Leidos not doing trajectories. Just been handed trajectories.

Shoot for 1-2 slides at meetings.

How research utilized?

Leave academic. Ignore math.

Start with Leidos baseline.

How is beluga is better than Leidos / AFRL baseline.

Real time FTSI by end of 2019

Not dependent on FTSI in the loop. Just recommended a method for trajectory optimization at end of PhD. Get trajectory data from Reasor.

Truncate end of trajectory?

Useful quantities.

What even is optimization. What does it give us. What are the constraints. What to optimize for.

Keep refining the story. Not well defined enough at the moment. Make up a scenario. Do something, make it better.



Planar hypersonic + Zermelos + Brachistochrone + Hamiltonian. Parameters with Sean + reduction. Give AIAA Journal a shot? Start writing. Maybe GNC.

Capability footprints, robustness, etc. Keep beluga enhancements small contribution. Jan 4th @ 2pm w/ prof grant.


Session planner

Womens too many people with 6. Have have rotations with 12. Need event info op I have 10 floor routines, but theres 15 people on beam. Sessions automated rotation manual
Womens side 3 gyms. 2 have 7 8 9. Other developmental. Developmental only available for 1 session.
Guys is 1 gym. Guys dont care about level. Keeps teams together.
Send kyle the shit.
