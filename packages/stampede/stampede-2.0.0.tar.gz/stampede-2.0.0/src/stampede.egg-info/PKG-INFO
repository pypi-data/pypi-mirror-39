Metadata-Version: 1.1
Name: stampede
Version: 2.0.0
Summary: A really simple job queue. Uses a rudimentary event loop and runs tasks in subprocesses (managed with signalfd). Doesn't support task arguments. Task results are rudimentary (only succcess or failure with exit code). When multiple requests are made for the same task they are collapsed into a single request.

            import stampede
        
        
            class MyWorker(StampedeWorker):
        
                def handle_task(self, name):
                    print("Perfoming work for task:", name)

        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.0.0 (2018-12-17)
        ------------------
        
        * Use more robust collection of child exit codes. Turns out that if there's enough pressure of the signalfd is fills up and
          needs extra ``os.waitpid()`` calls to collect the orphans.
        * Add a request API (``stampede.request``).
        * Add a request API that also spawns the daemon if not running (``stampede.request_and_spawn``).
        * Changed ``do_work`` to ``handle_task`` in StampedeWorker. **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE**
        * Update test grid to include Python 3.7 and PyPy3.
        * Changed how results are passed to the client (JSON instead of some crappy custom text format).
        
        1.0.0 (2015-10-19)

          (from the unmaintained `python-signalfd <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-signalfd>`_).
        * Switch to pytest.
