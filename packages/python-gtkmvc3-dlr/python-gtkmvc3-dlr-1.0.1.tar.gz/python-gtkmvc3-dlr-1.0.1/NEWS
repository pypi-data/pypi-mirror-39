* New

  - Change sensitivity to spurious notifications per observing method.
    You can still set it for a whole Observer subclass.

  - Added pattern matching for observer methods, including '*' to be notified
    about any property in any kind of model.

  - Optionally use special method names to connect a Controller to a View,
    instead of specifying handlers in Glade.

  - Properties can be defined as depending on other properties, so that
    changing one notifies about several.

  - You can now use the automatic type conversion done by adapters anywhere.

  - Optionally update a TreeView when models stored in it change.

  - Optionally connect cell renderers set up in Glade to models stored in a
    TreeView.

  - Adapt to arbitraty GObject properties.

* Changed

  - Radio buttons or actions are adapted to string properties.
    You still have to group them yourself.

  - Toggle actions and tool buttons are adapted to boolean properties.

  - Adapters now catch ValueError in widget getters.
    Use this if you don't want to influence the property value.

  - You can now observe method calls on set() properties.

  - View['non-existing name'] now raises KeyError instead of returning None.

  - Adapting a property string with dots now notifies about changes along
    the path.

* Fixed

  - No longer raises when you modify a property while setting up an adapter.

Released version 1.99.1

This is a release that keeps compatibility with previous version
1.99.0. However, some features provided in 1.99.0 are deprecated in
1.99.1.

This version goes in the direction of stabilizing the API and making
the code more robust. Many bugs were fixed, and a new, clean API is
now provided for defining notification methods in observers, and
logical observable properties in models.

The documentation has been updated and extended to reflect all changes, and a
complete Library Reference is now available. Furthermore, the documentation
now uses Sphinx instead of Latex to generate both pdf and html documentation
formats. 

Last but not the least, the team grew up! 

* New

  - Models now feature Logical Observable Properties, along with already
    supported Concrete Observable Properties.

  - In Observers notification methods have all the same prototype,
    which make much cleaner the application code.

  - New mechanism to declare both dynamically and statically
    notification methods in Observers.

  - Auto-adapt of FileChooserButton, ComboBox and Adjustment

  - API to extend default adapter list

  - More widget types now correctly cast when adapted to
    unicode/int/float properties.

  - Enable RoUserClassAdapter to update the widget.
    It used to only do it when connecting, not on property changes.
    This makes the built-in support for gtk.Calendar work in both
    directions.

  - Controller's method adapt() allows auto-adaption even if the view
    does not have corresponding widgets for *all* properties in the
    model.

  - Adapters can optionally call prop_write *instead of* casting the value from
    the widget to the type of the old property value. This was the intended
    behaviour all along. Default is still to call it after the cast.

  - Decorators for property setters/getters in models. The methods can now have
    arbitrary names and you are no longer limited to one property per method.

* Changed

  - Name-based notification methods like
    `property_<name>_value_change` are still supported, but their
    usage is now discouraged. A new mechanism for declaring
    notifications is now available, and you should consider porting
    applications accordingly.

  - Decorator Observer.observes is now deprecated. A new mechanism for
    declaring notifications is now available, and you should consider
    porting applications accordingly.

  - support GtkBuilder in addition to libglade, which is no longer
    required.
    This changed the signature of the View constructor. The two
    formats are not equivalent, as GTK cannot build only parts of a
    file.

  - allow creation of adapters that act on spurious notifications.

  - use less eval(codestring)
    This changed how adapters create observer functions. If you have
    adapter subclasses you will have to adjust them.

  - Misuse of the framework that used to exit your application can now be
    caught as exceptions.

  - Fewer warnings printed by the framework. Remember to increase the logging
    level during development.

* Fixed

  - Assigning a tuple with length 3 to a property no longer raises

  - Pass the correct model when emitting notifications for an
    inherited signal.
    This changes how all property wrappers track their owners, but
    your code should not be affected.

  - Wrapped sequences lacked crucial special methods like len and
    iter.

  - Inspecting wrappers no longer omits the class name.

  - Various changes to make SQLObjectModel actually usable.

  - Wrapping more than one sequence class could cause the wrong
    methods to be called on all but the last instance created. This
    did not affect programs that only use the built-in list type.

  - Mutable instances that used to be assigned to properties would
    notify of their changes even after being replaced in the model.

  - No more errors from static container adapters you didn't create.

  - Multiple concurrent iterators on views no longer steal each other
    widgets.


Many thanks to Christian Spoer for narrowing down a bug and to Tobias Weber
for joining the team.

Released version 1.99.0

This is a major release that breaks backward compatibility with the
1.2 family.

Also, this version is not stable yet, as there might be some changes
in the forthcoming releases toward version 2.0.0.

* New features
  Features 1 and 2 cause this version to be no backward compatible.
  
  1. View's constructor no longer takes a controller.

  2. Controller's constructor takes a view.
     This allows (together with 1.) to have multiple controllers
     controlling a shared view, making possible to decompose
     controllers (see the website for details)

  3. Support for SQLObject (support for SQLAlchemy delayed to 1.99.1)

  4. Support for custom observable properties in Models.
     Now it is possible to define observable properties whose values
     are stored outside the model, in a DB, a file, a network, etc.

  5. New syntax for defining observable properties.
     Now class attributes are used as in common ORMs.

  6. Explicit declaration of observing methods into observer through
     decorators.

  7. Views have attributes 'glade' and 'top' to simplify their
     construction.

  8. gtkmvc3 has now its own logging system that users can set when
     required. Previous naive prints have been removed. 

* Documentation
  1. New website

  2. New Quick Start Guide

  
* Refactoring, Bug fixes
  1. Improved performances

  2. Cleaned up View construction, that is now much more simple
  
  3. Fixed a row of minor bugs

Released version 1.2.2

This is a minor release that fixes two major bugs about adapters. 
A few new examples about adapters have been also added.

reporting it.

**********************************************************************

Released version 1.2.0

* New features:

  - Added adapters, new entities that largely simplify and reduce
    costs and development efforts. Adapters handles autonomous
    coordination between properties into models and widgets into
    views. Roughly speaking, an adapter keeps aligned some part of
    the model and a widget in a transparent and still customizable
    way.

  - Added script gtkmvc3-progen that aids developers in generating
    gtkmvc3-based projects from scratch. gtkmvc3-progen can be run in
    both batch and GUI modalities. For example:
    $> gtkmvc3-progen name=myproj author="Wil Shakespeare" gui=no

    ... generates project "myproj" in batch mode. See the user
    manual for a full list of available options.
    
* Other changes
  
  - Spurious value changes in observable properties are no longer
    notified by default. A new optional parameter of class Observer
    allows for a backward-compatible semantics.

  - Widgets search into Views has been optimized.

  - Bug fixes and optimizations. 

    o Undefined handlers for custom widgets are correctly
      managed. Thanks to Allan Douglas <zalguod TA users TOD
      sourceforge TOD net> for providing a working patch.

    o Fixed a subtle bug in the observer pattern implementation.

    o A few other minor fixes and optimizations.
