A minimal example of application.

The model contains a counter and a reset value.

The view shows both, and provides the possibility of changing the
reset value, increment the counter value, and reset the counter to the
reset value.

The view is loaded from a GtkBuilder file, and the low coupling among the
different values is guaranteed by the observable pattern.

To execute:
$> python main.py
