A minimal example of application, like basic but with a view 
build 'by hand' (not loaded from a glade file). 

model is exactly the same as in basic, the controller is similar, but
it handles gtk signal connections during view's registration.

The view is the most important part in this example, as it builds the
widgets completely by hand. Of course mxed solution are possible,
where the view is partially constructed fromo one or more glade files,
and some parts are still contructed by hand.

See the 'basic' example for further information.

To execute:
$> python main.py
