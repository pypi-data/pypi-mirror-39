MVC-O Infrastructure
====================

The *MVC-O* framework provides a simplified and modified implementation
of the *MVC* pattern, and a very straightforward implementation of the *Observer* pattern.

In the following a detailed description of each pattern is provided.
However, it is important to pinpoint here that the patterns have not
been implemented in a rigorous way. Instead, they have been adapted to
the particular way *PyGTK* based application are designed, making the
framework *easy* and *practical* to be used instead of being
fully compliant with the theoretical patterns.
