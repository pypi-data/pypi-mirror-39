s:about: |
  Building on our previous work on the ALEA software package, a computational toolbox for allele-specific
  epigenomics analysis incorporating allelic variation data, we detail here ALEA’s successor - MEA. This
  package dramatically increases the functionality and usability of ALEA, incorporating allelic variation
  with existing resources, allowing for the identification of significant associations of epigenetic
  modifications and specific allelic variants in human and mouse cells. Similar to ALEA, MEA provides a
  customizable pipeline for allele-specific analysis of next-generation sequencing data which takes raw
  sequencing data for ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and DNA Methylation analysis, producing a UCSC track hub. MEA
  takes advantage of the available genomic resources for human (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium) and
  mouse (The Mouse Genome Project) to reconstruct diploid in silico genomes for human samples or hybrid
  mouse samples. Then, for each accompanying ChIP-seq, RNA-seq or DNA Methylation dataset, MEA generates
  two wig files from short reads aligned differentially to each haplotype. This pipeline has been validated
  using human and hybrid mouse ChIPseq, RNAseq and DNA Methylation data.
