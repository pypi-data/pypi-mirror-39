pysignald is a Python client for the excellent [signald](https://git.callpipe.com/finn/signald) project, which in turn
is a command-line client for the Signal messaging service.

pysignald allows you to programmatically send and receive messages to Signal.

Installation
------------

You can install pysignald with pip:

```
$ pip install pysignald
```


Running
-------

Just make sure you have signald installed. Here's an example of how to use pysignald:


```python
from signald import Signal

s = Signal("+1234567890")

# If you haven't registered/verified signald, do that first:
s.register(voice=False)
s.verify("sms code")

s.send_message("+1098765432", "Hello there!")

for message in s.receive_messages():
    print(message)
```

You can also use the chat decorator interface:

```python
from signald import Signal

s = Signal("+1234567890")

@s.chat_handler("hello there", order=10)  # This is case-insensitive.
def hello_there(message, match):
    # Returning `False` as the first argument will cause matching to continue
    # after this handler runs.
    stop = False
    reply = "Hello there!"
    return stop, reply


# Matching is case-insensitive. The `order` argument signifies when
# the handler will try to match (default is 100), and functions get sorted
# by order of declaration secondly.
@s.chat_handler("hello", order=10)
def hello(message, match):
    # This will match on "hello there" as well because of the "stop" return code in
    # the function above. Both replies will be sent.
    return "Hello!"


@s.chat_handler(re.compile("my name is (.*)"))  # This is case-sensitive.
def name(message, match):
    return "Hello %s." % match.group(1)


@s.chat_handler("")
def catch_all(message, match):
    # This will only be sent if nothing else matches, because matching
    # stops by default on the first function that matches.
    return "I don't know what you said."

s.run_chat()
```

Various
-------

pysignald also supports different socket paths:

```python
s = Signal("+1234567890", socket_path="/var/some/other/socket.sock")
```

It supports TCP sockets too, if you run a proxy. For example, you can proxy signald's UNIX socket over TCP with socat:

```bash
$ socat -d -d TCP4-LISTEN:15432,fork UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/signald/signald.sock
```

Then in pysignald:

```python
s = Signal("+1234567890", socket_path=("your.serveri.ip", 15432))
```
