    Inherit this class to create a WorkGroup. It allows to index and combine
    groups of workers. For example, this class enables WorkGroups to be combined like:

    workgroup3 = workgroup1 + workgroup2

    It should be inherited to form a WorkGroup, where WorkGroup is a  group of
    individual scraper workers.

        :param staff: an integer number which represents how many workers to
        spin up for scraping.  It can be an arbitrary number.
        :param job_id: str(), the name
        :param timeout: tuple for python-requests timeout like (3.0, 700.0).
        You should not need to adjust the first number. But you may need to
        adjust the 2nd timeout number.  Definitely, if you use Crawlera. When using
        Crawlera, the 2nd timeout number is dependent on the website and
        optimization of the LUA SOURCE script to filter links that do not need
        followed in order to get the data that you are targeting.
