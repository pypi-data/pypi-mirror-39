This module contains classes to encapsulate data returned from a SplashScraper object
after a scrape in a format that is able to be pickled and saved in newt.db.

Any changes to this module should also be checked against the ScrapedDataExtractor
in the extractor.py file. The attributes here must match up to the
ScrapedDataExtractor.extract and ScrapedDataExtractor.write methods.
