# ezgame
ezgame is a framework that creates a small layer over pygame to make its usage more transparent. It's great for simple mathematical 2D graphics.

## Installation
`pip install ezgame`

## Dependencies
The ezgame module depends only on `pygame` and `point2d`. Both can be installed via `pip install` and should be automatically installed when you install `ezgame`.
