Description: **cfdm** is a complete implementation of the `CF data model
        <https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/10/4619/2017>`_, that identifies the
        fundamental elements of the `CF conventions
        <http://cfconventions.org/>`_ and shows how they relate to each other,
        independently of the `netCDF
        <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>`_ encoding.
        
        The central element defined by the CF data model is the **field
        construct**, which corresponds to a CF-netCDF data variable with all
        of its metadata.
        
        The **cfdm** package can
        
        * read field constructs from netCDF datasets,
        
        * create new field constructs in memory,
        
        * inspect field constructs,
        
        * test whether two field constructs are the same,
        
        * modify field construct metadata and data,
        
        * create subspaces of field constructs,
        
        * write field constructs to netCDF datasets on disk,
        
        * incorporate, and create, metadata stored in external files, and
        
        * read, write, and create data that have been compressed by convention
          (i.e. ragged or gathered arrays), whilst presenting a view of the
          data in its uncompressed form.
