Description: # Linux driver and daemon for Thermaltake Riing
        
        ## Compatibility
        currently supported devices are (as they show up in thermaltakes TTRGBPLUS software:  
            Riing Plus  
            Flow Riing RGB  
        If your's isnt listed, please create an issue and I'll implement it ASAP!! 
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Pypi
        The setup file will create the systemd user unit, and udev rule 
        `sudo pip install linux_thermaltake_rgb` 
        
        then add your user to the `plugdev` group - `sudo usermod -a -G plugdev <user>` 
        
        then reconnect your device. (you may need to log out and back in so your
        user is recognised as being in the `plugdev` group
        
        ## Configuration
        default configuration is in `/etc/linux_thermaltake_rgb/config.yml`
        edit and configure suitably.
        
        example config:
        
        ```
        # specify <port_number>:<device_type>
        # port number, referring to the usb hub controller your fans connect too.
        devices:

        # these are passed directly into the fan controller factory method in `daemon.fan_manager`
        # and as such, are just kwargs.
        fan_controller:
          type: temp_target
          target: 20
          sensor_name: k10temp
          multiplier: 5
        
        # alternatively, you can set a permanent speed
        # fan_controller:
        #   type: locked_speed
        #   speed: 80
        
        # same as fan_controller, these are kwargs passed into the lighting_manager factory method.
        lighting_controller:
          type: static
          r: 50
          g: 0
