        ## Installation
        
        ### Pypi
        The setup file will create the systemd user unit, and udev rule  
        `sudo pip3 install linux_thermaltake_rgb`  
        
        then add your user to the `plugdev` group - `sudo usermod -a -G plugdev <user>`  
        
        start and enable the systemd service  
        `systemctl --user start linux-thermaltake-rgb.service; systemctl --user enable linux-thermaltake-rgb.service`  
        
        then reconnect your device.  
          note: you may need to log out and back in so your user is recognised as being in the `plugdev` group  
        
        ## Configuration
        when installed with `pip3` default configuration is in `/etc/linux_thermaltake_rgb/config.yml`  
        edit and configure suitably.  
        
        example config is in `linux_thermaltake_rgb/assets/config.yml`
