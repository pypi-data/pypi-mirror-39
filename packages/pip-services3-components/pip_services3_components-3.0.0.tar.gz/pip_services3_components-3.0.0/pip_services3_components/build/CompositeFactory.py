    Aggregates multiple factories into a single factory component.
    When a new component is requested, it iterates through
    factories to locate the one able to create the requested component.

    This component is used to conveniently keep all supported factories in a single place.

    Example:
        factory = CompositeFactory()
        factory.add(new DefaultLoggerFactory())
        factory.add(new DefaultCountersFactory())

        factory.create(loggerLocator)     // Result: created NullLogger
