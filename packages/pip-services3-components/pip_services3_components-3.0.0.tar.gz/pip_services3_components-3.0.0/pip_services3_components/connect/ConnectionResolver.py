    Helper class to retrieve component connections.

    If connections are configured to be retrieved from [[IDiscovery]],
    it automatically locates [[IDiscovery]] in component references
    and retrieve connections from there using discovery_key parameter.

    ### Configuration parameters ###

        - connection:
            - discovery_key:               (optional) a key to retrieve the connection from IDiscovery
            - ...                          other connection parameters

        - connections:                  alternative to connection
            - [connection params 1]:       first connection parameters
            - ...                      connection parameters for key 1
            - [connection params N]:       Nth connection parameters
            - ...                      connection parameters for key N

    ### References ###
        - *:discovery:*:*:1.0    (optional) IDiscovery services to resolve connections
