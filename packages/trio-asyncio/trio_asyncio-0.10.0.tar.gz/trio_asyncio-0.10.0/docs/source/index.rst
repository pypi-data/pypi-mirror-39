trio-asyncio: A re-implementation of the asyncio mainloop on top of Trio
========================================================================

Trio-Asyncio is *the* library of choice for a Python program that 
contains both `trio`_ and `asyncio`_ code.

.. _asyncio: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html

With trio-asyncio, you can:

* incrementally convert your code to Trio. Start with a Trio mainloop, call
  your existing asyncio code, then successively convert procedures to Trio
  calling conventions.

* use any asyncio-capable library.

* use trio-asyncio as a building block for convincing other async-ish
  libraries (Twisted, Promise, â€¦) to be compatible with Trio.

Trio-Asyncio passes the test suite of some complex programs like
``home-assistant``.

In the past, the complete Python 3.6 test suite for asyncio and the tests
for some well-known libraries like aiohttp also Just Work(ed). This is no
longer the case because these tests rely heavily on stopping and restarting
the ``asyncio`` event loop. ``trio_asyncio`` no longer supports this.

Helpful facts:

* Supported environments: Linux, MacOS, or Windows running some kind of Python
  3.5.3-or-better (either CPython or PyPy3 is fine). \*BSD and illumus likely
  work too, but are untested.

* Install: ``python3 -m pip install -U trio-asyncio`` (or on Windows, maybe
  ``py -3 -m pip install -U trio-asyncio``). No compiler needed.
