        =======
        
        Discord.py rewrite utilities
        
        To install:
        
        Stable version (recommended if you don't want shit breaking)::
        
            # Unices
            python3 -m pip install libneko
            
            # Windows (one of these)
            python -m pip install libneko
            py -m pip install libneko
            
        Latest version (cant guarantee this even works)::
        
            # Unicies (with, and without git installed)
            python3 -m pip install git+https://gitlab.com/koyagami/libneko
            python3 -m pip install https://gitlab.com/koyagami/libneko/-/archive/master/libneko-master.zip
            
            # Windows (one of these should work. Windows is a pain in the arse. First two are with git, last two are without)
            python -m pip install git+https://gitlab.com/koyagami/libneko
            py -m pip install git+https://gitlab.com/koyagami/libneko
            python -m pip install https://gitlab.com/koyagami/libneko/-/archive/master/libneko-master.zip
            py -m pip install https://gitlab.com/koyagami/libneko/-/archive/master/libneko-master.zip

        This is still in pre-release development, and is by no means finished. If you
        update, expect to have to change code as I iron out any issues internally.
