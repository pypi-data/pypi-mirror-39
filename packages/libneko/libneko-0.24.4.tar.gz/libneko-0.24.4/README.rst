For the time being, this is being discontinued. I might pick it up again in the future

Discord.py rewrite utilities

To install:

Stable version (recommended if you don't want shit breaking)::

    # Unices
    python3 -m pip install libneko
    
    # Windows (one of these)
    python -m pip install libneko
    py -m pip install libneko
    
Latest version (cant guarantee this even works)::

    python3 -m pip install https://gitlab.com/koyagami/libneko/-/archive/master/libneko-master.zip
    
    # Windows (one of these should work. Windows is a pain in the arse. First two are with git, last two are without)
    python -m pip install git+https://gitlab.com/koyagami/libneko
    py -m pip install git+https://gitlab.com/koyagami/libneko

"Hey! I updated and it broke my code! I hate you and wish a pox on your mailman!"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is still in pre-release development, and is by no means finished. If you
update, expect to have to change code as I iron out any issues internally.
