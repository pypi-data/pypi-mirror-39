# Overview of the Phenotype Ranking measure (Phrank)

Goal: match the most relevant gene or disease with the patient phenotypes


Disease -> HPO:XXXX, HPO:XXXXX, HPO:XXXXXX
Patient -> Phenotypes -> HPO:XXX, HPO:XXX, HPO:XXX


All HPO terms project onto a corresponding node in the HPO ontology DAG

We use OMIM gene-disease-phenotype mappings to estimate the probability of observing each phenotype
