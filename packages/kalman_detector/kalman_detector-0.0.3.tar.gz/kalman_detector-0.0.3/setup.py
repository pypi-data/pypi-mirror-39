      long_description='''This module implements the kalman detector score along with the equivalent cumulative fourier
       score. Score is designed to receive X(f), a sequence of "amplitudes" (where f is an arbitrary indexed parameter)
       and decide between: 
       H0: X(f) = N(f)  pure gaussian noise
       H1: X(f) = A(f) + N(f) where A(f) is a smooth gaussian field with a low-pass power spectra where the smoothness parameter
       unknown. 
       Was originally written for detecting Fast Radio Bursts, but can be used to many other types of signals including 
       AGN light curves.
