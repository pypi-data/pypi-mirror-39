The reason for this project is to provide a wrapper to easily perform operations
against Go. I've been writing a lot of shell scripts to interact with Go using
curl, but when going a little further than the most basic interactions I've
always started to feel the need for doing all of this in a proper programming
language. I.e. something that is beyond bash.

I've chosen to use Python and version 2.6.6 and newer as my target platform,
with no external dependencies, to make it really straightforward to install/run
on RHEL6 and other similar *stable* distributions.

This library was created to support `a Go CLI`__, to handle some common
scenarios you as an admin or advanced user would do.

`API documentation`_ available on read the docs.

Usage
-----

The main interaction point for this library is the `Server` class,
it contains helpers to instantiate the different API endpoints.

An example interaction:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from gocd import Server
    >>> server = Server('http://localhost:8153', user='ba', password='secret')
    >>> pipeline = server.pipeline('Example-Pipeline')
    >>> response = pipeline.history()
    >>> bool(response)
    True
    >>> response.status_code
    200
    >>> response.content_type
    'application/json'
    >>> response.is_ok
    True
    >>> response.body
