sridentify
===========

Overview
--------

``sridentify`` is a command-line utility and Python API for quickly
identifying the `EPSG Registry Code <http://www.epsg-registry.org/>`__
from a ``.prj`` file typically associated with `ESRI
Shapefiles <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile>`__. It ships with a
SQLite database containing mappings of `Well-known
Text <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text>`__ strings to EPSG
codes, the bulk of which was manually sourced and cleaned from `an ESRI
website <https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/pcs.html>`__.
It's not complete, however, and in the event you test it against a WKT
string not in the database it will search the
`prj2epsg.org <http://prj2epsg.org>`__ API. If the API returns an exact
match, that code is returned and saved to the SQLite database. Handling
several partial matches is currently planned, but not yet implemented.

``sridentify`` is written in Python, 2- and 3-compatible, and has no external dependencies.


Installation
------------

``pip install --user sridentify``

The ``--user`` is important if installing system-wide (i.e., not in a virtualenv), because the
user running ``sridentify`` must have write permissions on the SQLite database in the event that
``sridentify`` tries to save a new result fetched from the ``prj2epsg`` API to the database.

By default ``pip install --user`` will install to ``$HOME/.local`` and place the executable script
in ``$HOME/.local/bin``. You should add this to your ``$PATH`` if you want to run ``sridentify``
without having to specify the full location to the executable.

Quickstart
----------

Command-Line usage
------------------

.. code:: bash

    $ sridentify seattle_land_use.prj
    2285

    # Example use in conjunction with the `shp2pgsql` command-line utility
    # that ships with PostGIS. Assuming you have a PostGIS-enabled database named `seattle`,
    # and you have a shapefile called `seattle_land_use` that you want to import into that database
    # but you're not sure what spatial projection the shapefile uses.

    $ shp2pgsql -s $(sridentify seattle_land_use.prj) -g the_geom -ID seattle_land_use.shp | psql -d seattle

Python API usage
-------------------

.. code:: python

    >>> from sridentify import Sridentify

    >>> # Read .prj file from the filesystem
    >>> ident = Sridentify()
    >>> ident.from_file('/path/to/seattle_land_use.prj')
    >>> ident.get_epsg()
    2285

    >>> # Paste in Well-Known Text string directly
    >>> ident = Sridentify(prj="""PROJCS["NAD_1983_StatePlane_Washington_North_FIPS_4601_Feet",GEOGCS["GCS_North_American_1983",DATUM["D_North_American_1983",SPHEROID["GRS_1980",6378137.0,298.257222101]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],UNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433]],PROJECTION["Lambert_Conformal_Conic"],PARAMETER["False_Easting",1640416.666666667],PARAMETER["False_Northing",0.0],PARAMETER["Central_Meridian",-120.8333333333333],PARAMETER["Standard_Parallel_1",47.5],PARAMETER["Standard_Parallel_2",48.73333333333333],PARAMETER["Latitude_Of_Origin",47.0],UNIT["Foot_US",0.3048006096012192]]""")
    >>> ident.get_epsg()
    2285


Background
----------

More and more governments and organizations are making their GIS data available to the public on
open data portals. Local governments typically store and use GIS data in the `map projection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection>`__ most appropriate for their location on planet Earth. For the United States, this is typically the `State Plane Coordinate System <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Plane_Coordinate_System>`__. Other common systems are `Universal Transverse Mercator <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system>`__, or a highly localized system that is accurate only within the geographic boundaries of the entity's jusrisdiction.

ESRI Shapefiles are a common format for publishing GIS data, although a "shapefile" with the ``.shp`` extension is really just data describing the geometry. Shapefiles are typically bundled with a ``dBase`` file ( ``.dbf`` extension ) which contains data attributes about the geometry and a small text file describing the spatial reference system of the geomtry in WKT format.

``sridentify`` is not meant to be a full-fledged client library to the actual
EPSG database, for that you're probably looking for something like `python-epsg <https://github.com/geo-data/python-epsg>`__

Rather, ``sridentify`` is for those looking to quickly identify the EPSG code
of a shapefile, especially when `importing into PostGIS <http://postgis.net/docs/manual-2.2/using_postgis_dbmanagement.html#shp2pgsql_usage>`__ . Of course, you could use `ogr2ogr <http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html>`__
to convert everything into a web-friendly projection, like:

.. code:: bash

    $ ogr2ogr -f PostgreSQL -t_srs EPSG:4326 PG:dbname=seattle seattle_land_use.shp

But transforming spatial data from one projection to another is a lossy operation
and can result in coordinate drift. Ideally, you would store the original data
in its original coordinate system and then transform copies as needed.
