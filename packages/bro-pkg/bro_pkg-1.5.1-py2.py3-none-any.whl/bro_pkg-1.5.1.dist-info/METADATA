Bro Package Manager
===================

The Bro Package Manager makes it easy for Bro_ users to install and manage third
party scripts as well as plugins for Bro and BroControl.  The command-line tool
is preconfigured to download packages from the `Bro package source`_ , a GitHub
repository that has been set up such that any developer can request their Bro
package be included. See the ``README`` file of that repository for information
regarding the package submission process.

:note: It's left up to users to decide for themselves via code review, GitHub
       comments/stars, or other metrics whether any given package is trustworthy
       as there is no implied guarantees that it's secure just because it's been
       accepted into the default package source.

See the package manager documentation_ for further usage information, how-to
guides, and walkthroughs.  For offline reading, it's also available in the
``doc/`` directory of the source code distribution.
