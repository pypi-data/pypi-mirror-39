Description: # icinga2telegram
        
        icinga2telegram is a small Python script to send your [Icinga2](https://icinga.com) alerts to
        Telegram. It also adds emojis to your alerts to highlight the type and importance of the alert.
        (You can disable it with `--no-emojis`.)

        ## Why Python instead of a simple Bash script?
        Several other people implemented Icinga2-Telegram notifications by writing a simple Bash
        script. Most of the time this works but there are a few things I do not like about the
        Bash solutions:
        
        1. They use two scripts with almost the same content.
        2. Bash can screw up really bad when your alert output contains special characters.
        3. The Bash solutions are based on enviroment variables. This does not work natively with
        Icinga2 director as it only supports arguments in command defintions.
        
        Obviously the Python implementation has a bigger footbrint than the Bash solution. It
        requires a Python interpreter and installs several Python packages as dependencies. This
        could be a problem for an embedded system with very limited resources but most Icinga2
        instances run on powerful machines and the icinga2telegram footprint does not matter there.
        In return you get a single maintainable and robust script that you can use for host and
        service notifications.
        
        ## Installation and Setup
        
        ### Install icinga2telegram
        It is recommended (but not required) to install icinga2telegram in a Python virtualenv.
        ```
        pip install icinga2telegram
        ````
        
        Run `icinga2telegram --help` to see all available options.
        
        ### Create a Telegram Bot
        You need to create a Telegram bot by talking to the Botfather of Telegram. Please follow
        the [official instructions](https://core.telegram.org/bots#creating-a-new-bot) and
        copy your bot token. You will need it for the Icinga2 configuration.
        
        ### Get your CHAT-ID
        Now you need to talk to your new bot because a bot can not start a new chat. Just open a
        chat with your bot and send a message. Afterwards you have to fetch the CHAT-ID of
        the conversation between you and your bot. Replace TOKEN with your actual token.
        
        ```
        curl -s 'https://api.telegram.org/botTOKEN/getUpdates'
        ```
        
        If you have `jq` installed it is even simpler with:
        ```
        curl -s 'https://api.telegram.org/botTOKEN/getUpdates' | jq '.result[].message.chat'
        {
          "id": CHAT-ID,
          "first_name": "Max",
          "username": "exampleuser",
          "type": "private"
        }
        ```
        
        Copy your CHAT-ID. You will need it for the Icinga2 configuration.
        If you want to add more users everyone has to send a message to your bot and you need to
        extract the CHAT-IDs as shown above.
        (You can also invite your bot to groups but then you have to write a message like `@yourbot foo`
        to the group to send the message (with your CHAT-ID) to your bot.)
        
        
        ## Icinga2 Example Configuration
        
        This is just one way to use icinga2telegram for your notifications. Of course you can use another
        way to glue your users, CHAT-IDs and the actual notifications together.
        
        ### User Definition with your CHAT-ID as a Variable
        ```
        object User "max" {
            display_name = "Max"
            enable_notifications = true
            vars.telegram_chat_id = "CHAT-ID"
        }
        ```
        
        ### Notification Definition for Hosts
        ```
        apply Notification "Max (Host)" to Host {
            command = "icinga2telegram Host"
            assign where host.address
            users = [ "max" ]
        }
        ```
        
        ### Notification Definition for Services
        ```
        apply Notification "Max (Service)" to Service {
            command = "icinga2telegram Service"
            assign where host.address
            users = [ "max" ]
        }
        
        ```
        
        ### Command Definition for Hosts
        ```
        object NotificationCommand "icinga2telegram Host" {
            import "plugin-notification-command"
            command = [ "/opt/icinga2telegram/bin/icinga2telegram" ]
            timeout = 1m
            arguments += {
                "--address" = "$address$"
                "--chat" = "$user.vars.telegram_chat_id$"
                "--hostdisplayname" = "$host.display_name$"
                "--hostname" = "$host.name$"
                "--hostoutput" = "$host.output$"
                "--hoststate" = "$host.state$"
                "--icingaweb2url" = "https://monitoring.example.com/icingaweb2"
                "--notification-author" = "$notification.author$"
                "--notification-comment" = "$notification.comment$"
                "--notification-type" = "$notification.type$"
                "--time" = "$icinga.timet$"
                "--token" = "TOKEN"
            }
        }
        ```
        
        ### Command Definition for Services
        ```
        object NotificationCommand "icinga2telegram Service" {
            import "plugin-notification-command"
            command = [ "/opt/icinga2telegram/bin/icinga2telegram" ]
            timeout = 1m
            arguments += {
                "--address" = "$address$"
                "--chat" = "$user.vars.telegram_chat_id$"
                "--hostdisplayname" = "$host.display_name$"
                "--hostname" = "$host.name$"
                "--hostoutput" = "$host.output$"
                "--hoststate" = "$host.state$"
                "--icingaweb2url" = "https://monitoring.example.com/icingaweb2"
                "--notification-author" = "$notification.author$"
                "--notification-comment" = "$notification.comment$"
                "--notification-type" = "$notification.type$"
                "--servicedisplayname" = "$service.display_name$"
                "--servicename" = "$service.name$"
                "--serviceoutput" = "$service.output$"
                "--servicestate" = "$service.state$"
                "--time" = "$icinga.timet$"
                "--token" = "TOKEN"
            }
        }
        ```
