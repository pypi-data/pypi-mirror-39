        The problem is solved in one or more GMM steps. During each step, any parameters in :math:`\hat{\theta}` are
        optimized to minimize the GMM objective value. If there are no parameters in :math:`\hat{\theta}` (for example,
        in the Logit model there are no nonlinear parameters and all linear parameters can be concentrated out), the
        objective is evaluated once during the step.

        If there are nonlinear parameters, the mean utility, :math:`\delta(\hat{\theta})` is computed market-by-market
        with fixed point iteration. Otherwise, it is computed analytically according to the solution of the Logit model.
        If a supply side is to be estimated, marginal costs, :math:`c(\hat{\theta})`, are also computed
        market-by-market. Linear parameters are then estimated, which are used to recover structural error terms, which
        in turn are used to form the objective value. By default, the objective gradient is computed as well.

        .. note::

           This method supports :func:`parallel` processing. If multiprocessing is used, market-by-market computation of
           :math:`\delta(\hat{\theta})` and, if :math:`X_3` was formulated by ``product_formulations`` in
           :class:`Problem`, of :math:`\tilde{c}(\hat{\theta})`, along with associated Jacobians, will be distributed
           among the processes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sigma : `array-like, optional`
            Configuration for which elements in the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix that measures
            agents' random taste distribution, :math:`\Sigma`, are fixed at zero and starting values for the other
            elements, which, if not fixed by ``sigma_bounds``, are in the vector of unknown elements, :math:`\theta`.

            Rows and columns correspond to columns in :math:`X_2`, which is formulated according
            ``product_formulations`` in :class:`Problem`. If :math:`X_2` was not formulated, this should not be
            specified, since the Logit model will be estimated.

            Values below the diagonal are ignored. Zeros are assumed to be zero throughout estimation and nonzeros are,
            if not fixed by ``sigma_bounds``, starting values for unknown elements in :math:`\theta`.

        pi : `array-like, optional`
            Configuration for which elements in the matrix of parameters that measures how agent tastes vary with
            demographics, :math:`\Pi`, are fixed at zero and starting values for the other elements, which, if not fixed
            by ``pi_bounds``, are in the vector of unknown elements, :math:`\theta`.

            Rows correspond to the same product characteristics as in ``sigma``. Columns correspond to columns in
            :math:`d`, which is formulated according to ``agent_formulation`` in :class:`Problem`. If :math:`d` was not
            formulated, this should not be specified.

            Zeros are assumed to be zero throughout estimation and nonzeros are, if not fixed by ``pi_bounds``, starting
            values for unknown elements in :math:`\theta`.

        rho : `array-like, optional`
            Configuration for which elements in the vector of parameters that measure within nesting group correlation,
            :math:`\rho`, are fixed at zero and starting values for the other elements, which, if not fixed by
            ``rho_bounds``, are in the vector of unknown elements, :math:`\theta`.

            If there is only one element, it corresponds to all groups defined by the ``nesting_ids`` field of
            ``product_data`` in :class:`Problem`. If there is more than one element, there must be as many elements as
            :math:`H`, the number of distinct nesting groups, and elements correspond to group IDs in the sorted order
            given by :attr:`Problem.unique_nesting_ids`. If nesting IDs were not specified, this should not be specified
            either.

            Zeros are assumed to be zero throughout estimation and nonzeros are, if not fixed by ``rho_bounds``,
            starting values for unknown elements in :math:`\theta`.

        beta: `array-like, optional`
            Configuration for which elements in the vector of demand-side linear parameters, :math:`\beta`, are
            concentrated out of the problem. Usually, this is left unspecified, unless there is a supply side, in which
            case parameters on endogenous product characteristics cannot be concentrated out of the problem. Values
            specify which elements are fixed at zero and starting values for the other elements, which, if not fixed by
            ``beta_bounds``, are in the vector of unknown elements, :math:`\theta`.

            Elements correspond to columns in :math:`X_1`, which is formulated according to ``product_formulations`` in
            :class:`Problem`.

            Both ``None`` and ``numpy.nan`` indicate that the parameter should be concentrated out of the problem. That
            is, it will be estimated, but does not have to be included in :math:`\theta`. Zeros are assumed to be zero
            throughout estimation and nonzeros are, if not fixed by ``beta_bounds``, starting values for unknown
            elements in :math:`\theta`.

        gamma: `array-like, optional`
            Configuration for which elements in the vector of supply-side linear parameters, :math:`\gamma`, are
            concentrated out of the problem. Usually, this is left unspecified. Values specify which elements are fixed
            at zero and starting values for the other elements, which, if not fixed by ``gamma_bounds``, are in the
            vector of unknown elements, :math:`\theta`.

            Elements correspond to columns in :math:`X_3`, which is formulated according to ``product_formulations`` in
            :class:`Problem`. If :math:`X_3` was not formulated, this should not be specified.

            Both ``None`` and ``numpy.nan`` indicate that the parameter should be concentrated out of the problem. That
            is, it will be estimated, but does not have to be included in :math:`\theta`. Zeros are assumed to be zero
            throughout estimation and nonzeros are, if not fixed by ``gamma_bounds``, starting values for unknown
            elements in :math:`\theta`.

        sigma_bounds : `tuple, optional`
            Configuration for :math:`\Sigma` bounds of the form ``(lb, ub)``, in which both ``lb`` and ``ub`` are of the
            same size as ``sigma``. Each element in ``lb`` and ``ub`` determines the lower and upper bound for its
            counterpart in ``sigma``. If ``optimization`` does not support bounds, these will be ignored.

            By default, if bounds are supported, the diagonal of ``sigma`` is bounded from below by zero. Conditional on
            :math:`X_2`, :math:`\mu`, and an initial estimate of :math:`\mu`, default bounds for off-diagonal parameters
            are chosen to reduce the need for overflow safety precautions.

            Values below the diagonal are ignored. Lower and upper bounds corresponding to zeros in ``sigma`` are set to
            zero. Setting a lower bound equal to an upper bound fixes the corresponding element, removing it from
            :math:`\theta`. Both ``None`` and ``numpy.nan`` are converted to ``-numpy.inf`` in ``lb`` and to
            ``numpy.inf`` in ``ub``.

        pi_bounds : `tuple, optional`
            Configuration for :math:`\Pi` bounds of the form ``(lb, ub)``, in which both ``lb`` and ``ub`` are of the
            same size as ``pi``. Each element in ``lb`` and ``ub`` determines the lower and upper bound for its
            counterpart in ``pi``. If ``optimization`` does not support bounds, these will be ignored.

            By default, if bounds are supported, conditional on :math:`X_2`, :math:`d`, and an initial estimate of
            :math:`\mu`, default bounds are chosen to reduce the need for overflow safety precautions.

            Lower and upper bounds corresponding to zeros in ``pi`` are set to zero. Setting a lower bound equal to an
            upper bound fixes the corresponding element, removing it from :math:`\theta`. Both ``None`` and
            ``numpy.nan`` are converted to ``-numpy.inf`` in ``lb`` and to ``numpy.inf`` in ``ub``.

        rho_bounds : `tuple, optional`
            Configuration for :math:`\rho` bounds of the form ``(lb, ub)``, in which both ``lb`` and ``ub`` are of the
            same size as ``rho``. Each element in ``lb`` and ``ub`` determines the lower and upper bound for its
            counterpart in ``rho``. If ``optimization`` does not support bounds, these will be ignored.

            By default, if bounds are supported, all elements are bounded from below by ``0``, which corresponds to the
            simple Logit model. Conditional on an initial estimate of :math:`\mu`, upper bounds are chosen to reduce the
            need for overflow safety precautions, and are less than ``1`` because larger values are inconsistent with
            utility maximization.

            Lower and upper bounds corresponding to zeros in ``rho`` are set to zero. Setting a lower bound equal to an
            upper bound fixes the corresponding element, removing it from :math:`\theta`. Both ``None`` and
            ``numpy.nan`` are converted to ``-numpy.inf`` in ``lb`` and to ``numpy.inf`` in ``ub``.

        beta_bounds : `tuple, optional`
            Configuration for :math:`\beta` bounds of the form ``(lb, ub)``, in which both ``lb`` and ``ub`` are of the
            same size as ``beta``. Each element in ``lb`` and ``ub`` determines the lower and upper bound for its
            counterpart in ``beta``. If ``optimization`` does not support bounds, these will be ignored.

            Usually, this is left unspecified, unless there is a supply side, in which case parameters on endogenous
            product characteristics cannot be concentrated out of the problem. It is generally a good idea to constrain
            such parameters to be nonzero so that the intra-firm Jacobian of shares with respect to prices does not
            become singular.

            By default, all non-concentrated out parameters are unbounded. Bounds should only be specified for
            parameters that are included in :math:`\theta`; that is, those with initial values specified in ``beta``.

            Lower and upper bounds corresponding to zeros in ``beta`` are set to zero. Setting a lower bound equal to an
            upper bound fixes the corresponding element, removing it from :math:`\theta`. Both ``None`` and
            ``numpy.nan`` are converted to ``-numpy.inf`` in ``lb`` and to ``numpy.inf`` in ``ub``.

        gamma_bounds : `tuple, optional`
            Configuration for :math:`\gamma` bounds of the form ``(lb, ub)``, in which both ``lb`` and ``ub`` are of the
            same size as ``gamma``. Each element in ``lb`` and ``ub`` determines the lower and upper bound for its
            counterpart in ``gamma``. If ``optimization`` does not support bounds, these will be ignored.

            By default, all non-concentrated out parameters are unbounded. Bounds should only be specified for
            parameters that are included in :math:`\theta`; that is, those with initial values specified in ``gamma``.

            Lower and upper bounds corresponding to zeros in ``gamma`` are set to zero. Setting a lower bound equal to
            an upper bound fixes the corresponding element, removing it from :math:`\theta`. Both ``None`` and
            ``numpy.nan`` are converted to ``-numpy.inf`` in ``lb`` and to ``numpy.inf`` in ``ub``.

        delta : `array-like, optional`
            Initial values for the mean utility, :math:`\delta`. If there are any nonlinear parameters, these are the
            values at which the fixed point iteration routine will start during the first objective evaluation. By
            default, the solution to the sample Logit model is used:

            .. math:: \delta_{jt} = \log s_{jt} - \log s_{0t}.

            If there is nesting, the solution to the nested Logit model under the initial ``rho`` is used instead:

            .. math:: \delta_{jt} = \log s_{jt} - \log s_{0t} - \rho_{h(j)}\log\frac{s_{jt}}{s_{h(j)t}}

            where

            .. math:: s_{h(j)t} = \sum_{k\in\mathscr{J}_{h(j)t}} s_{kt}.

        W : `array-like, optional`
            Starting values for the weighting matrix, :math:`W`. By default, the 2SLS weighting matrix,
            :math:`(Z'Z)^{-1}`, is used.
        method : `str, optional`
            The estimation routine that will be used. The following methods are supported:

                - ``'1s'`` - One-step GMM.

                - ``'2s'`` (default) - Two-step GMM.

            Iterated GMM can be manually implemented by executing single GMM steps in a loop, in which after the first
            iteration, nonlinear parameters and weighting matrices from the last :class:`ProblemResults` are passed as
            arguments.

        optimization : `Optimization, optional`
            :class:`Optimization` configuration for how to solve the optimization problem in each GMM step, which is
            only used if there are unfixed nonlinear parameters over which to optimize. By default,
            ``Optimization('slsqp', {'ftol': 1e-12})`` is used. Routines that do not support bounds will ignore
            ``sigma_bounds`` and ``pi_bounds``. Choosing a routine that does not use analytic gradients will slow down
            estimation.
        error_behavior : `str, optional`
            How to handle any errors. For example, it is common to encounter overflow when computing
            :math:`\delta(\hat{\theta})` at a large :math:`\hat{\theta}`. The following behaviors are supported:

                - ``'revert'`` (default) - Revert problematic :math:`\delta(\hat{\theta})` elements to their last
                  computed values and use reverted values to compute :math:`\partial\xi / \partial\theta`, and, if the
                  supply side is considered, to compute both :math:`\tilde{c}(\hat{\theta})` and
                  :math:`\partial\omega / \partial\theta` as well. If there are problematic elements in
                  :math:`\partial\xi / \partial\theta`, :math:`\tilde{c}(\hat{\theta})`, or
                  :math:`\partial\omega / \partial\theta`, revert these to their last computed values as well. If there
                  are problematic elements in the first objective evaluation, revert values in
                  :math:`\delta(\hat{\theta})` to their starting values; in :math:`\tilde{c}(\hat{\theta})`, to prices;
                  and in Jacobians, to zeros. In the unlikely event that the gradient or its objective have problematic
                  elements, revert them as well, and if this happens during the first objective evaluation, revert the
                  objective to ``1e10`` and its gradient to zeros.

                - ``'punish'`` - Set the objective to ``1`` and its gradient to all zeros. This option along with a
                  large ``error_punishment`` can be helpful for routines that do not use analytic gradients.

                - ``'raise'`` - Raise an exception.

        error_punishment : `float, optional`
            How to scale the GMM objective value after an error. By default, the objective value is not scaled.
        delta_behavior : `str, optional`
            Configuration for the values at which the fixed point computation of :math:`\delta(\hat{\theta})` in each
            market will start. This configuration is only relevant if there are unfixed nonlinear parameters over which
            to optimize. The following behaviors are supported:

                - ``'first'`` (default) - Start at the values configured by ``delta`` during the first GMM step, and at
                  the values computed by the last GMM step for each subsequent step.

                - ``'last'`` - Start at the values of :math:`\delta(\hat{\theta})` computed during the last objective
                  evaluation, or, if this is the first evaluation, at the values configured by ``delta``. This behavior
                  tends to speed up computation but may introduce some instability into estimation.

        iteration : `Iteration, optional`
            :class:`Iteration` configuration for how to solve the fixed point problem used to compute
            :math:`\delta(\hat{\theta})` in each market. This configuration is only relevant if there are nonlinear
            parameters, since :math:`\delta` can be estimated analytically in the Logit model. By default,
            ``Iteration('squarem', {'tol': 1e-14})`` is used.
        fp_type : `str, optional`
            Configuration for the type of contraction mapping used to compute :math:`\delta(\hat{\theta})`. The
            following types of contraction mappings are supported:

                - ``'safe'`` (default) - The standard linear contraction mapping,

                  .. math:: \delta_{jt} \leftarrow \delta_{jt} + \log s_{jt} - \log s_{jt}(\delta, \hat{\theta}),

                  with safeguards against numerical overflow. Specifically, during choice probability computation, the
                  maximum utility of each agent is subtracted away before utilities are exponentiated, and the logit
                  expression is re-scaled accordingly.

                - ``'linear'`` - Standard linear contraction mapping, but without safeguards against numerical overflow.
                  This option may be preferable to ``'safe'`` if utilities are reasonably small.

                - ``'nonlinear'`` - Exponentiated version,

                  .. math:: \exp(\delta_{jt}) \leftarrow \exp(\delta_{jt})s_{jt} / s_{jt}(\delta, \hat{\theta}),

                  which can be faster because fewer logarithms need to be calculated. Additionally, when there are no
                  nesting parameters, as in :ref:`references:Brunner, Heiss, Romahn, and Weiser (2017)`,
                  :math:`\exp(\delta)` is cancelled out of the numerator in the expression for
                  :math:`s(\delta, \hat{\theta})`, which slightly reduces the computational burden. This formulation can
                  also help mitigate problems stemming from any negative integration weights; however, it is generally
                  less stable than the linear versions.

            This option is only relevant if there are nonlinear parameters, since :math:`\delta` can be estimated
            analytically in the Logit model.

            Also note that when there are nesting parameters, the contraction is dampened by :math:`1 - \rho` as in
            :ref:`references:Grigolon and Verboven (2014)`. Although necessary, this dampening implies a slower rate of
            convergence, especially for large values of :math:`\rho`.

        costs_type : `str, optional`
            Marginal cost specification. The following specifications are supported:

                - ``'linear'`` (default) - Linear specification: :math:`\tilde{c} = c`.

                - ``'log'`` - Log-linear specification: :math:`\tilde{c} = \log c`.

            This specification is only relevant if :math:`X_3` was formulated by ``product_formulations`` in
            :class:`Problem`.

        costs_bounds : `tuple, optional`
            Configuration for :math:`c` bounds of the form ``(lb, ub)``, in which both ``lb`` and ``ub`` are floats.
            This is only relevant if :math:`X_3` was formulated by ``product_formulations`` in :class:`Problem`. By
            default, marginal costs are unbounded.

            When ``costs_type`` is ``'log'``, nonpositive :math:`c(\hat{\theta})` values can create problems when
            computing :math:`\tilde{c}(\hat{\theta}) = \log c(\hat{\theta})`. One solution is to set ``lb`` to a small
            number. Rows in Jacobians associated with clipped marginal costs will be zero.

            Both ``None`` and ``numpy.nan`` are converted to ``-numpy.inf`` in ``lb`` and to ``numpy.inf`` in ``ub``.

        center_moments : `bool, optional`
            Whether to center the sample moments before using them to update weighting matrices. By default, sample

            How to update the weighting matrix. This has no effect if ``method`` is ``'1s'``. Often, ``se_type`` should
            be the same. The following types are supported:

                - ``'robust'`` (default) - Heteroscedasticity robust weighting matrices.

                - ``'unadjusted'`` - Homoskedastic weighting matrices. Errors are always centered when computing this
                  type of weighting matrix, so ``center_moments`` has no effect.

                - ``'clustered'`` - Clustered weighting matrices, which account for arbitrary within-group correlation.
                  Clusters must be defined by the ``clustering_ids`` field of ``product_data`` in :class:`Problem`.

            How to compute standard errors. Often, ``W_type`` should be the same. The following types are supported:

                - ``'unadjusted'`` - Homoskedastic standard errors. Unadjusted standard errors are computed under the
                  assumption that weighting matrices are optimal.

                - ``'clustered'`` - Clustered standard errors, which account for arbitrary within-group correlation.

class Problem(ProblemEconomy):
    r"""A BLP problem.

    This class is initialized with relevant data and solved with :meth:`Problem.solve`.

    In both ``product_data`` and ``agent_data``, fields with multiple columns can be either matrices or can be broken up
    into multiple one-dimensional fields with column index suffixes that start at zero. For example, if there are three
    columns of excluded demand-side instruments, the ``demand_instruments`` field in ``product_data``, which in this
    case should be a matrix with three columns, can be replaced by three one-dimensional fields:
    ``demand_instruments0``, ``demand_instruments1``, and ``demand_instruments2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    product_formulations : `Formulation or tuple of Formulation`
        :class:`Formulation` configuration or tuple of up to three :class:`Formulation` configurations for the matrix
        of linear product characteristics, :math:`X_1`, for the matrix of nonlinear product characteristics,
        :math:`X_2`, and for the matrix of cost characteristics, :math:`X_3`, respectively. If the formulation for
        :math:`X_3` is not specified or is ``None``, a supply side will not be estimated. Similarly, if the formulation
        for :math:`X_2` is not specified or is ``None``, the Logit model will be estimated.

        Variable names should correspond to fields in ``product_data``. The ``shares`` variable should not be included
        in any of the formulations and ``prices`` should be included in the formulation for :math:`X_1` or :math:`X_2`
        (or both). The ``absorb`` argument of :class:`Formulation` can be used to absorb fixed effects into :math:`X_1`
        and :math:`X_3`, but not :math:`X_2`. Generally speaking, all exogenous characteristics in :math:`X_2` should
        also be included in :math:`X_1`. The exception is characteristics that are collinear with fixed effects in
        :math:`X_1`.

        Characteristics in :math:`X_1` that do not involve ``prices`` will be combined with the below specified excluded
        demand-side instruments to create the full set of demand-side instruments, :math:`Z_D`. Any fixed effects
        absorbed into :math:`X_1` will also be absorbed into :math:`Z_D`. Similarly, characteristics in :math:`X_3` will
        be combined with the excluded supply-side instruments to create :math:`Z_S`, and any fixed effects absorbed into
        :math:`X_3` will also be absorbed into :math:`Z_S`.

        .. warning::

           Characteristics that involve prices, :math:`p`, should always be formulated with the ``prices`` variable. If
           another name is used, :class:`Problem` will not understand that the characteristic is endogenous, so it may
           be erroneously included in :math:`Z_D`, and derivatives computed with respect to prices (which are computed
           during supply-side estimation and post-estimation routines) will likely be wrong. For example, to include a
           :math:`p^2` characteristic, include ``I(prices**2)`` in a formula instead of manually including a
           ``prices_squared`` variable in ``product_data`` and a formula.

    product_data : `structured array-like`
        Each row corresponds to a product. Markets can have differing numbers of products. The following fields are
        required:

            - **market_ids** : (`object`) - IDs that associate products with markets.

            - **shares** : (`numeric`) - Market shares, :math:`s`.

            - **prices** : (`numeric`) - Product prices, :math:`p`.

            - **demand_instruments** : (`numeric`) - Excluded demand-side instruments, which together with the
              formulated exogenous linear product characteristics (:math:`X_1` except for characteristics involving
              ``prices``, :math:`X_1^p`), constitute the full set of demand-side instruments, :math:`Z_D`.

        If a formulation for :math:`X_3` is specified in ``product_formulations``, the following fields are also
        required, since they will be used to estimate the supply side of the problem:

            - **firm_ids** : (`object, optional`) - IDs that associate products with firms. Any columns after the first
              can be used to compute post-estimation outputs for firm changes, such as mergers.

            - **supply_instruments** : (`numeric, optional`) - Excluded supply-side instruments, which together with the
              formulated cost characteristics, :math:`X_3`, constitute the full set of supply-side instruments,
              :math:`Z_S`.

        In addition to supply-side estimation, the ``firm_ids`` field is also needed to compute some post-estimation
        outputs. If ``firm_ids`` are specified, custom ownership matrices can be specified as well:

            - **ownership** : (`numeric, optional`) - Custom stacked :math:`J_t \times J_t` ownership matrices,
              :math:`O`, for each market :math:`t`, which can be built with :func:`build_ownership`. By default,
              standard ownership matrices are built only when they are needed. If specified, each stack is associated
              with a ``firm_ids`` column and must have as many columns as there are products in the market with the most
              products.

        To estimate a nested Logit or random coefficients nested Logit (RCNL) model, nesting groups must be specified:

            - **nesting_ids** (`object, optional`) - IDs that associate products with nesting groups. When these IDs are
              specified, ``rho`` in :meth:`Problem.solve`, the vector of parameters that measure within nesting group
              correlation, must be specified as well.

        Finally, clustering groups can be specified to account for arbitrary within-group correlation while computing
        standard errors and weighting matrices:

            - **clustering_ids** (`object, optional`) - Cluster group IDs, which will be used when estimating standard
              errors and updating weighting matrices if ``covariance_type`` in :meth:`Problem.solve` is ``'clustered'``.

        Along with ``market_ids``, ``firm_ids``, ``nesting_ids``, ``clustering_ids``, and ``prices``, the names of any
        additional fields can be used as variables in ``product_formulations``.

    agent_formulation : `Formulation, optional`
        :class:`Formulation` configuration for the matrix of observed agent characteristics called demographics,
        :math:`d`, which will only be included in the model if this formulation is specified. Since demographics are
        only used if there are nonlinear product characteristics, this formulation should only be specified if
        :math:`X_2` is formulated in ``product_formulations``. Variable names should correspond to fields in
        ``agent_data``.
    agent_data : `structured array-like, optional`
        Each row corresponds to an agent. Markets can have differing numbers of agents. Since simulated agents are only
        used if there are nonlinear product characteristics, agent data should only be specified if :math:`X_2` is
        formulated in ``product_formulations``. If agent data are specified, market IDs are required:

            - **market_ids** : (`object`) - IDs that associate agents with markets. The set of distinct IDs should be
              the same as the set of IDs in ``product_data``. If ``integration`` is specified, there must be at least as
              many rows in each market as the number of nodes and weights that are built for each market.

        If ``integration`` is not specified, the following fields are required:

            - **weights** : (`numeric, optional`) - Integration weights, :math:`w`.

            - **nodes** : (`numeric, optional`) - Unobserved agent characteristics called integration nodes,
              :math:`\nu`. If there are more than :math:`K_2` columns, only the first :math:`K_2` will be used.

        Along with ``market_ids``, the names of any additional fields can be used as variables in ``agent_formulation``.

    integration : `Integration, optional`
        :class:`Integration` configuration for how to build nodes and weights for integration over agent utilities,
        which will replace any ``nodes`` and ``weights`` fields in ``agent_data``. This configuration is required if
        ``nodes`` and ``weights`` in ``agent_data`` are not specified. It should not be specified if :math:`X_2` is not
        formulated in ``product_formulations``.
