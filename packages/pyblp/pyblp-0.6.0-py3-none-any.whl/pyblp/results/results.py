           Note that :math:`\partial U_{i1} / \partial p_1` is the derivative of utility for the first product with
           respect to its price. The first product is chosen arbitrarily because the consumer surpluses computed by this
           method assumes that there are not nonlinear income effects, which implies that this derivative is the same
           for all products. Computed consumer surpluses will be incorrect if a formulation contains, for example,
           ``log(prices)``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        prices : `array-like, optional`
            Prices at which utilities and price derivatives will be evaluated, such as equilibrium prices, :math:`p^*`,
            computed by :meth:`ProblemResults.compute_prices`, or approximate equilibrium prices, :math:`p^a`, computed
            by :meth:`ProblemResults.compute_approximate_prices`. By default, unchanged prices are used.

        Returns
        -------
        `ndarray`
            Estimated population-normalized consumer surpluses, :math:`\text{CS}`, for all markets. Rows are in the same
            order as :attr:`Problem.unique_market_ids`.
