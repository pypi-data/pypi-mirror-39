def build_id_data(T: int, J: int, F: int, mergers: Sequence[Dict[int, int]] = ()) -> RecArray:
    r"""Build a balanced panel of market and firm IDs.

    This function can be used to build ``id_data`` for :class:`Simulation` initialization.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T : `int`
        Number of markets.
    J : `int`
        Number of products in each market.
    F : `int`
        Number of firms. If ``J`` is divisible by ``F``, firms produce ``J / F`` products in each market. Otherwise,
        firms with smaller IDs will produce excess products.
    mergers : `tuple of dict, optional`
        Each dictionary adds a column of changed firm IDs to the returned matrix of firm IDs. Changed firm IDs are
        identical to the first column of firm IDs, but IDs that are dictionary keys will be replaced with their values,
        which should also be firm IDs between ``0`` and ``F - 1``.

    Returns
    -------
    `recarray`
        IDs that associate products with markets and firms. Each of the ``T * J`` rows corresponds to a product. Fields:

            - **market_ids** : (`object`) - Market IDs that take on values from ``0`` to ``T - 1``.

            - **firm_ids** : (`object`) - Firm IDs that take on values from ``0`` to ``F - 1``. Any columns after the
              first are defined according to ``mergers``.

def build_ownership(product_data: Mapping, kappa_specification: Optional[Callable[[Any, Any], float]] = None) -> Array:
    r"""Build ownership matrices, :math:`O`.

    Ownership matrices are defined by their cooperation matrix counterparts, :math:`\kappa`. For each market :math:`t`,
    :math:`O_{jk} = \kappa_{fg}` where :math:`j \in \mathscr{J}_{ft}`, the set of products produced by firm :math:`f` in
    the market, and similarly, :math:`g \in \mathscr{J}_{gt}`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    product_data : `structured array-like`
        Each row corresponds to a product. Markets can have differing numbers of products. The following fields are
        required:

            - **market_ids** : (`object`) - IDs that associate products with markets.

            - **firm_ids** : (`object`) - IDs that associate products with firms. Each column will be used to construct
              one stack of ownership matrices. If there are multiple columns, this field can either be a matrix or it
              can be broken up into multiple one-dimensional fields with column index suffixes that start at zero. For
              example, if there are two columns, this field can be replaced with two one-dimensional fields: `firm_ids0`
              and ``firm_ids1``.

    kappa_specification : `callable, optional`
        A function that specifies each market's cooperation matrix, :math:`\kappa`. The function is of the following
        form::

            kappa(f, g) -> value

        where ``value`` is :math:`O_{jk}` and both ``f`` and ``g`` are firm IDs from the ``firm_ids`` field of
        ``product_data``.

        The default specification, ``lambda: f, g: int(f == g)``, constructs traditional ownership matrices. That is,
        :math:`\kappa = I`, the identify matrix, implies that :math:`O_{jk}` is :math:`1` if the same firm produces
        products :math:`j` and :math:`k`, and is :math:`0` otherwise.

        If ``firm_ids`` happen to be indices for an actual :math:`\kappa` matrix, ``lambda f, g: kappa[f, g]`` will
        build ownership matrices according to the matrix ``kappa``.

    Returns
    -------
    `ndarray`
        Stacked :math:`J_t \times J_t` ownership matrices, :math:`O`, for each market :math:`t`. Each stack is
        associated with a ``firm_ids`` column. If a market has fewer products than others, extra columns will contain
        ``numpy.nan``.
