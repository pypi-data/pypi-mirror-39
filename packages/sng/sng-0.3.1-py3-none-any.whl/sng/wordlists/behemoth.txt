1. Antichristian Phenomenon

been haunted be the paws ov fear
and felt his breath upon my neck
I was granted with the pain divine
and my voice was heard no more in heaven

great in power
thus call'st me almighty
in not be first archangel
I shall be the last among thee

come over to seduce your angels
been born to rape your mother's holy womb
rebel
so call me now
as I stand above ye all

leave me unworshipped
in the dens below forever I shall dwell
malice in heart was bred and lives again
my legions hid in south eden
my flaming passions
oceans ov love
and all thou call'st
the evil
I summon thee
bringer ov war
bearer ov light
earth's son

great in power
thus call'st me almighty
in not be first archangel
I shall be the last among thee


2. The Act Of Rebellion

fucked by hecate
yet I shall not be yours
no fantasies nor the promised grace
I will chase you down
rid me ov slavery
strengthen up my mind
with a bliss from below

call me not, never, bow ye down, honour

ride the southern blaze, lighting up my throne
see me star arise, hear my nature's call
I summon the beast, call loud out its name
will never to fall, yet to be restored

heal me not, never, bow ye down, honour

te'o enashet anakaelo hecate seloen es esseka a
eloeono tee beyes emeggiel ekse derete ena'tiru
kaeon per'aa a emiel eschetar esie kau neres


3. Inflamed With Rage

listen ye all who can preach
I am the god's begotten son
I tell three woe shall be no more
woe, thou shalt end up in flames!

no horns I have nor pair ov wings
I am the balance ov thy universe
I have no number
I have no name
not fear'd ov laws
need to restrain

ancestor ov all gods
the one among the ancient ones

speak ye all who can speak
keep thy instincts ever alert
thou art the stars that shine among us
and honour me as thee adore the sun

and stand ye all brave and proud
and watch the babel hill turn into ash
admire my shapes among the ruins of jericho
behold my wrath I hath showered the earth

ancestor ov all gods
the one among the ancient ones
the paynim rite drew in my shade
I am the one who begot the earth


4. Pan Satyros

I, pan satyros
rise I through ye spiral light
follow'd I ye path ov a'yin,
where ye all-begetting eye rests
across ye cascade ov sensations
and ye consciousness ov body
volcano ov emotions am I
ye ring ov saturn -
two thousand years am I and more

by ye four powers ov sphinx
ye book ov albion open'd -
and four cherubic beasts
each in one quarter
wander'd across ye world

ye holiest gathering ov souls
ov ye fool empty sight -
ye devil - wild laugh
and my mourning, as snow white
paradox ov meanings
sacrifice is done
dogs ov darkness to ashes reduc'd
in ye sirius shine
that my way illuminates
in company ov heaven
ye eternal one
in madness ov night
in madness ov day


5. Natural Born Philosopher

without sin I can't make religion
as without sin there's no whoredom
and when in my heart god becomes a harlot
I shall sin, sin, sin again
("...every world has its space
every life has its time
every mass has its god
every god has his guillotine... ")

to possess thy mother I desire not
nay, to slay thy father neither
'tis thy god I yearn to kill
thus reigning universal

with my beak I wanna peck at his face
and from ye golden cups divine blood drink
trespass borders which do not exist
I wanna be born, grow and rise again

and become! become you unity!
be all and nothing equally -
dust ov universe and its essence -
and look attentively
every star is a stone
in the cosmic pavement on which step you
and your oddysey has no beginning
and never look to far, you fool!
'cause it has no fuckin' end!

by nails tear this thin membrane
show me ye eye ov revenge
spit out half dead foetus out-consciousness
long live the man!
to god - quick death!
(your god is dead now...)


6. Christians To The Lions

behold bastard son
I am the evil one
no glory to be reached
no more thy slavery
the passion I besieged
spawn terror
smash thy will
ye pale dominion fades away my
will dominates

and watch my star arise
burning up the earth
sun - the eye of gods
threw into the space
watch ye moon eclipse
fallinf from thy grace
watch all nations cry
all feared ov his name
praise the flame!
watch angels falling from the skies
praise the flame!
I killed thy god
my will is done!
thou art lord

rise me! rise me high!
lead thru the gates ov sun
rise me! rise me high!
where angels do not dare to fly
invite to feast ov gods
and let me drift away
leave flames ov infamy
and watch me kiss the stars


7. Inauguration Of Scorpio Dome

mere emeles
mere selem
I em'a den
lashtal
lvcifer!
lvcifer!
aivass!

so every man and woman is a star
but who is scorpio by fire ring'd
where fall means increase?

when on the throne ov life he seats
the bloody sword ov freedom sways
and light ov hells in his eyes
and secret breath ov love

as the first whore ov the world
banish'd god from body
carnal divinity she restor'd
as infinite ov nightsky
augmn ov sothis
when tunnel ov tuat means disorder
past, future, painful
and from the eternal revolt we're born
to word can make flesh

a breeze- a leaf- a shadow the falling of a bud-
the wind across the meadow- a flesh of light-
a call- a patter on the wall-the air is bright as
blood a moment stands a shadow a moment
sounds a call


8. In The Garden Of Dispersion

on ye hill
where ye sun behind horizon hides
there is nothing
except our breaths
and crux of events
and some crux ov our hands

on ye hill
where shadow wings fell
wind rose ye to song
and we plung'd in its deep
and in plaitiv waterfall depths

evanescent recollection ov atavisms
secret ov living in ye death posture
and then...
the ye seal in the garden ov dispersion
closes ye mouth
closes ye eyes
closes ye ears

in fields ov eden
under ye first tree's rotting root
there's feast
typhon's feast
and night came moonless
but yet ye light appear'd -
picture ov sigillic angels
grafting in our holy body and mind


9. The Universe Illumination

ov circus my world wiseman call'd
ov drunken trickster bed
and not violators of thoughts they're
for life is a theatre
in which actors all we are
but when curtain is open
there is no time for any reh's

and as all lights turn'd on were
and the first act is begun...
...and the last my mouth I open'd
i, purple sage in the universal
and I speak in tongue unknown
and behold all stood in flames

su na'aq tem kah chaph keb ngaa sul tamed mes
no sedem cha'no umes maog etem chaph keb la'at
qui sulib

and hardly ye remember dark november days
when received ye rain ov sulphur
when earth came apart under thine feet
and wasn't it rage ov thine god
and wasn't ye his somdom
it's "only" laugh mine empty
sob silent and helpless gesture


10. Vinvm Sabbati

waters' running down
by the silver moonrays -
towards the foundation
reflecting themselves
in the mirror ov dreams
and creating deadly forms ov life

vinvm sabbati
crystal formula
melted by the fire ov lust

etera zetgiell
emoke selene a helios
bey este'ike eliech
zeresse'naa essekeeee

astral dominion
by the witches virtu's rul'd
desire equinox
tension releas'd
liberated
in the senses dance

vinvm sabbati
where the sigil branded
on the breast, for'head
and temple ov atlantis

rise we upon the ladder
ov blasphemies
towering o'er the heavens
where our empty laugh rings
and fingers touch the face
ov god disabled


11. 23 (The Youth Manifesto)

23 year ov long journey
among the living dead
on nonsense nourish'd I
my naked soul and where am i?
in the palace ov underworld
without enemy nor friend
pay I for fathers legacy
half-man, half-beast
DEMIGOD

and my hanger was never fed
my desires never fulfilled
but my wish to become
the one with universe
has always entangled me
and forsaken I shall not be
though my flesh is torn apart
though my heart seems dead and cold
my will transgress
the spirit lives on!

1. Antichristian Phenomenon

Been haunted be the paws ov fear
And felt his breath upon my neck
I was granted with the pain divine
And my voice was heard no more in heaven

Great in power
Thus call'st me almighty
Un not be first archangel
I shall be the last among thee

Come over to seduce your angels
Been born to rape your mother's holy womb
Rebel
So call me now
As I stand above ye all

Leave me unworshipped
In the dens below forever I shall dwell
Malice in heart was bred and lives again
My legions hid in south Eden
My flaming passions
Oceans ov love
And all thou call'st
The evil
I summon thee
Bringer ov war
Bearer ov light
Earth's son

Great in power
Thus call'st me almighty
In not be first archangel
I shall be the last among thee


2. Malice



3. From The Pagan Vastlands 2000

From the land which hasn't entered yet
into the history
From the depths of swamps we are bringing
Proudly our name
As night, kissing the moonlight
-rebel children living in twilight
Like wolves...
...some named us so...

union with people from the sign
Of the half moon
To crush the golden walls of earthly heaven
To strangle the pestilence
Th the lands of mighty Empire
Others even think about us with fear
We invaded a state with a sword
In ours hands Roma means nothing
In the land of Slavs

Today forests sing about the legend
Long forgotten spirits
Whose names nobody remembers now
Waiting their day to reborn
Their visions of past
Are torturing our souls
Whispering in the dark
They will come again
To reign supreme
Believe my woods

From unrememberance
From Fire and Water
Ancient powers gather
From the burnt Arcona
...From the Pagan Vastlands!

Black horse rides across the sky
With a sword we will open the amber gates of Nawia!

Dzieci Svantevitha nienawidzš Chrystusa!
Dzieci Svantevitha nienawidzš boga-krzyża!


4. Satanas

[Sarcófago cover]

On fire of darkness
rise a scream of hate
Sathanas want vomit
on son of God's face
your eyes have wrath
and promising a slaughter
the angels of Lucifer
are ready to destroy

Sathanas

Sathanas revenge's started
and the heaven is burning
God angels are deads
and the survivors are praying
the sacred cross is breacked
and demons are smiling
because your lord Sathanas
raped the mother of false

Sathanas
Sathanas


5. Hello Spaceboy

[David Bowie cover]

Space...
Space...
Spaceboy

Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary

Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I want to be free

Don't you want to be free
Do you like girls or boys
It's confusing these days

But moondust will cover you
Cover you

This chaos is killing me
Space fucking boy

Spaceboy, fuck you
Space fucking boy

Bye bye love
Bye bye fucking spaceboy
Bye bye love
Fuck up Spaceboy!

Bye bye my love


6. Day Of Suffering

[Morbid Angel cover]

A call to take your hand
For I'm at one with the dark
How dare you come for me
And again you must die

So ancient curse known to me
Behold the powers I unleash
Upon your throne
Know my words, feel my hate descend

Lord of light
I will swarm against you now
Gods perverse
Wickeds at my side
Misery
Thorns to lance your every word
Nazarene
Now I crown you king in pain

Suffer


7. Carnage

[Mayhem cover]

Witchcraft, blood and Satan
Meet the face of Death
Blood
Fire
Torture
Pain
KILL

Witchcraft, blood and Satan
Meet the face of Death
Blood
Fire
Torture
Pain
KILL

Winds of war, winds of hate
Armageddon, tales from Hell
The wage of mayhem, the wage of sin
Come and hear, Lucifer sings

Command for blood, command for war
Command for Satan, command for Hell
Command for blood, command for war
Command for Satan, command for Hell
Command for blood
Command for Satan
Command for you

1. Horns Ov Baphomet

Rise thy horns
For I'm at one with the dark
Divine presence ascends
Touching the forehead ov god

Hark! I was not, I have become
In rapture, in vengeance, in blood
From word into flesh
From man into god

"Strive ever to more"
So spake the wisdom ov snake
"Hold up thyself"
Sayeth the law ov the brave

Beyond all I am
Let it be known
Within my blood fire stirs
Thee I invoke, The Unspoken One

As the wolf among sheep yet cower I do not
Victorious, glorious, constantly thirsting
And as the anger fuels my heart and will
No longer fear that which feeble men fear

"No rest for conquerors!", Legions of Typhon Seth await
Conquering child ov Mars breathes out war formula
"Ain Soph Aur
Protect my ways
Enlighten my paths
Consume me with thy rays"

I, the heart ov Tiphareth is waiting
The centre and secret ov the Sun
I invoke the Sothis rites, as day and night I'm reborn
...We shall all be one with the flames, from above...


2. Modern Iconoclast

The centuries ov woe have passed away
With eternal youth at my command I unleash hell!
Cast out ov Egypt were we, with lust embraced serpentine heart
Our wrath shalt now shower o'er the earth
Praise to thee, whose tongue doth speak fire

Dionisos, Orpheus, Attis, Osiris
Slain now resurrected, shackled now released
Ha Nuterut
Amoi Henut
Sat Heseut
Imoi Merut

Bring forth ecstasy, the ulmost delight
Come wholly to me as lifes' water is poured by thy side
'twas from sacred society not mother we were spawned
To manifest by Will alone our visions, more it be!

We are the khaos warriors
The architects ov fate
Our sight sees far beyond
The light of the day
Our thoughts secluded well
Amidst the darkness of night
Shall be no final warning
Before our battle cry!

Breathe out in ecstasy, swallow the seed of truth
Transgression is the might, transgression is the key
This is the law of scourge, the EYE ov true revenge
Placing trust upon our blade against ignorance

Dionisos, Orpheus, Attis, Osiris
Slain now resurrected, shackled now released
Ha Nuterut
Amoi Henut
Sat Heseut
Imoi Merut

Hear is crippled souls, behold is ye blind fools
Awake in fear and feel the touch ov bitter bliss
Its no time for repenting, its time to kiss our swords
We are the new beginning, we light our torch ov war

We are the kaos warriors
Modern iconoclast
Cleansers, lurking, waiting
To conquer the universe
We are all and without equal
Our fists crush the concrete walls
Our hearts infused with rage
In freedom our souls burn
Conquered we can be not
Our fate 'tis fueled by forces
Awakening to herald
The dawn of New Aeon rites


3. Here And Beyond

Arrived we to the days ov our beginning
To the City ov God clothed with the mists
Enslaved by life we danced spinning
In the taverns of time we used to sit
And drunk with memories
Dead moments glorified

I saw the phantoms ov Golgotha
Legion Legion
Fed on dust ov dead
Anoited by the grey ash
Mad, twisted mob ov Jerusalem

Then Raphael beyond me and night appear'd
Bent and The Word was announc'd

An archangelic grreting (Jetzirah! Jetzirah!)
The sign ov Portal, reality ov nature
Not to be, but to become
In aimless wandering across the time

On the sea ov possibilities untouched I stood
From my hand cracked heaven idols are falling to the pieces
Reached the horizon
Dagger in the air
Sylphs work is done
Oracles ov past aeons fulfill'd

Live we on the edge ov the worlds
In titanic turn ov time
Here and beyond
Carried on the wings ov the sun
Infinite, sacred power we call
And sight hardly can catch the moment ov eternity
When drink with light
In light we will live

And in the formless rapture
Will we sing psalm ov Might
The last spell ov Will:
"We are one
We are none!"


4. As Above So Below

I've seen strange signs on my way
Silent shadows
Dancing shapes
And angels fallen on the earth

Face up
And look there
When the root ov thy being cannot reach

Art thou Nephilim child?
Are ye looking for thy Elysium?
Here among the living trees?
Among the fading stars, variablility ov forms?

Sometimes love, Sometimes sadness ov things
Sometimes rapture, and wine o sabbath
Sometimes hatred, divine rage
And 93 rears, no limit, beyond the sin - gilgolem

Ye taught me the secret words:
IAO SABAO
Protect thy Daimon

Why why whisper thoughts
But might is raised
When conjurer of seasons
Hums the song...sorrowful, joyful
Night is eternal
And day is eternal
With runes ov life
And runes ov death
As above, so below
Now it's time ov the Beast


5. Blackest Ov The Black

From beyond all paths ov man I drew my rules
Infamous among gods and low I did fall
And the earth hath cried aloud
Hark! For enraged winds and storms now awaken
Now see me naked, yet draped in flames
My pent fury to unleash upon men

Ov khaos I am, the disobediant one
Depraved son who hath dwellt in nothingness
Upon the ninth I fell, from grace up above
To taste this life ov sin, to give birth to the "I"

I didst create demigods, strong in will and deed
That they may stand proud and call out thy names
How dare thou cross the paths ov mine
And leave my fallen sons behind
Oh, I shall feast in Gutter, as king ov nothing
I shall feed on thee, the Mightiest One
Behold! For I am Him!
Life giving flower that belongst to the dawn

Hear...
Feel...
Pray...
Kneel...

No holiness rules over my freedom
No commands from above I obey
I seek the ruin, I shake the worlds
Behold! I am blackest ov the black

Ov khaos I am, the disobediant one
Depraved son who hath dwellt in nothingness
Upon the ninth I fell, from grace up above
To taste this life ov sin, to give birth to the "I"


6. Hekau 718

A ka dua tuf ur biu
Bi a chefu dudu ner af an nuteru
Kha her nest af ur ar uatu an ba an khu an kha
Au aper ku khu am aper


7. The Harlot Ov The Saints

Ho Ophios ho archaios
Ho Drakon ho megas
Ho en kai ho on kai
Ho zon tous aionas
Meta tou pneumatos sou
Ho Ophios ho archaios
Ho Drakon ho megas

Whore ov abominations
I invoke theel
The harlot ov the saints
The source of snake's lust
Descend! Enter!
In the great hall ov fire and ice
The rose! Bloom with merciless love

Ho Ophios ho archaios
Ho Drakon ho megas
Ho en kai ho on kai
Ho zon tous aionas
Meta tou pneumatos sou
Ho Ophios ho archaios
Ho Drakon ho megas

I hold you in my hands
Yet it is you who hurts me...
....Eternally
From the midnight hour
To the midday one
Together we're enduring
Bounded by spell
Reconciled with time
Thou art Alfa and Omega
Light ov West and light ov East
I, The Eye in The Triangle
Citizen ov Corinth
(And looked into the eyes ov Angel)
The slave ov thy might

The Lord is slain, let us lament
The Word made void, the Work is vain
Fullfiling their obscure event
Let us rejoice, the Lord is slain


8. No Sympathy For Fools

FOOLS! I cast you all aside!
Your bullets harm me not
I am heresy, blazing hell
The embodiment ov all you fear
I am all which you can never be
A truth revealing hate machine
No longer will I tolerate
Lies from a kingdom built on dread
Yet what if naught exists above?
No shining glory and no god
You question not, blindly believe
Upon your ignorance I shall feast
Damn higher virtues, divine love
Your wooden idols and your law
Kneel before your god yet do not see
He doth feel you lies
Blinds you with fear
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
Your hearts I shall tear
With paws ov truth
With slashing jaws I rape
Your feeble womb
No god exists to save you from thy doom

You will never see the light!
Bound to always live by lies!


9. Zos Kia Cultus

Praise to thee - Sabbath Goat
Rising from the smoke
Entheogenic god
Dwelt in inbetweeness
In quadriga sexualis
Thou art mysttery unveiled

On the sun we fed
Worshiiped spirit in matter descended
Through the mists ov the highest mountains led
Out ov darkness ov ignorance
Into the light ov reality

Touch and say:
"This is the flesh and blood ov mine"
Look: Atmospheric "I":
Blessed be who have seen

Fools in the slime
Their world shrills with fear
Kali Yuga: shells ov qliphoth manifest
Decline! Decline!

Beyond the dead words
Going across the gnostic waste
Drifting in infinite experience
From Nowhere to Nowhere
In the dreams ov eld heard we atavistic chant:
Zos Kia Cultus: Nagual-Hoor-Lam
Certainty, not faith
Instinct - desire - and will!
Naught in all, all in naught

Touch and say:
"This is the flesh and blood ov mine"
Look: Atmospheric "I":
Blessed be who have seen

By the Fire and Force
I command thee, spirits ov the deep
Thoughts - theriomorphic shades
Creep and obey me!
Demons - perfected dissolution
"In non - atomic fact ov universality"
This is my sweet solitude


10. Fornicatus Benefictus

Almighty asmodeus, existant of chaos
Ominous be thy name
Thy kingdom come on earth
Lead me into all temptation of my flesh
So I may trespass greatly into
Thy ways by my desires
For thou art all sex-seeking unity
Thou mighty genitalia of creation
That knoweth no satiation
Grant thou my wish
For thou art power, ecstasy and actuality amen!


11. Typhonian Soul Zodiack

Above the high temple ov matter
Svastikas ov time slash the heaven
And from the pit, from the slime
From the thought
Gliphotic intruder decays
Lilith, Thantilaxath, Zi'uaq
Non-manifestation born in the dark ov a day

Can you hear distant desert call?
And stone you see - by Adytum builders
...rejected, damned?
Deeper, deeper, in the night, world, fear
Towards the noctuary ov the truth

From the mirror we crawls out
Devouring Eden's light
In the tunnels ov Seth he abides
Shugal, The Howler!

Who am I? Where I'm going? Where?
We live dreaming
Slipping from body to body
And nightmares still our breath
And his in our souls
Poisoning with the venom ov existence

Just say "Illusion"
When the first sunray falls
In your hawk eye
And don't look in the past
It hurts and there the Shadow lies in wait
So with every step on the oath
Beyond good and evil
Stronger GOD you became


12. Heru Ra Ha: Let There Be Might

Heru Ra Ha
Flaming tongue of art
Awake the lion's strength
Consumed by the ancient breath
Diffracted ray of Ra
Send me on thy wings
Devour all fears that I breed
And come, as I summon thee

IA TA BA ET
IA AZHI DA HA KA

Ra Hoor Khu
By ithyphallic spell
Skin illuminates deep within
I invoke thy names
Spirits ov the earth
Crush the slaves ov dog
Open the gates
Ov liberated will!

IA TA BA ET
IA AZHI DA HA KA

Heru Ra Ha
Let me see in the dark
Wisdom of which I fear not
And mute the weakness in my heart
Let there be might
Sothis raised we await
The Mighty One from above
Multitude of stars transform into God

IA TA BA ET
IA AZHI DA HA KA

1. Sculpting The Throne Ov Seth

[music and lyrics by Nergal; opening acoustic theme by Seth]

come forth!
from the void beyond the stars
from the blackened shores Thee arrive
Thou art ov gods
yet supreme above them all
Thou art mocked and blessed

speak ov me not as one
speak ov me not as none
speak ov me not at all
for I am continual

crowned and conquering child
cast aside the prophets and false gods ov Thy ways
from the outer space
when TONUAL cross NAGUAL
beyond becoming, Thou hast become...

speak ov me not as one
speak ov me not as none
speak ov me not at all
for I am continual

let me reign as a god among slaves!

spirit clad in gold
Seraphs incarnate
shake loose the shackles ov a million years
children ov Seth
blast wide the portals
unveil the raptures
ov Thy kingdom

speak ov me not as one
speak ov me not as none
speak ov me not at all
for I am continual

let me reign as a god among slaves!

Io Khepesh!
Io Nubti!
Io Akhakh!
Io Simai!

[lead: Nergal]
[lead: Seth]

["Sculpting the Throne ov Seth" is a warlike manifesto. to make its message straight and clear: there are no gods but ourselves. there is more land to be conquered. there are more kingdoms to be ruled. need I say more? I guess not... it's pretty much all I am about these days. no compromise and no surrender I say.]


2. Demigod

[music and lyrics by Nergal]

behold! children ov Cain
all beings not ov reptilian form
be upon them!
spare none! mercy cast aside!
those who feareth not my sacred blade
shall be blessed

repent not!
Thou art man
god is no more
rise now above the weakness ov flesh
come forth! join ye the arsenals ov blasphemy
follow the One
who spurred Roman warring legions

rise up! o power from sea below all seas
SIRIUS! DRACONIS!
awake from everlasting dream!
spirits ov abomination
formless Thou hath appeared before me
I am before all things

chthonic gods! those from beyond the stars
commander ov hosts devour the flesh ov man
may their weapons melt like wax
may their tongues be torn apart
may Apophis grind their bones
may their ashes be scattered all around...

[lead: Nergal]

hear me! o vermin!
how couldst Thou fall so low?
redemption thru denial
restriction becomes a sin
mankind! so pure...
castrate Thy impotent god
vomit forth the blasphemy
and forever shalt Thee win

[oh, how many times I have tried to express my deep inner gate and disgust towards everything that's so stagnated and one dimensional. so I had to create Demigod. being that expresses the most expansive and uncompromising virtues and instincts. I choose chose to take as my own: individuality, life affirmation, ambition, determination and vitality. musically it's just pure stream ov energy, and every time I listen to the opening theme I see the berserking, frienzied, undefeated Roman legions.]

["What is good? - everything augments the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself, in man. What is evil? - whatever springs from weakness. What is happiness? - the feeling that power increases - that resistance is overcome." -Friedrich Nietzsche, The Antichrist]


3. Conquer All

[music and lyrics by Nergal]

Mightiest Self!
cast out ov Thy Elysium
with blood ov nazarene
I write the story ov man
2000 years is nothing
thought it has been enough
come forth victorious
muting the foul angelic choirs!

none ov thy empty gods, shall ever stand above me
none ov thy weak brothers, shalt ever share my blood
my awareness, catalyst, ov godhate I have spawned
in sinister ecstasy eternally I decompose

race ov man!
the errors ov a wise make Thy rules
ye shall see
rather than the perfection ov the fool
the most divine!
I am many! among so very few
beyond redemption, beyond the weak
thus I beheld the truth!

none ov thy empty gods, shall ever stand above me
none ov thy weak brothers, shalt ever share my blood
my awareness, catalyst, ov godhate I have spawned
in sinister ecstasy eternally I'm decomposed

[lead: Nergal]

I am the pure flame that burns
I am (ever shining) Sirius son
I am the infinite space
I am the most conquering One

[Crowley said "I will give you a war-engine. With it ye shall smite the peoples; and none shall stand before you. (...) Conquer! That is enough." and with "Conquer All" I try to extend the meaning ov these mighty words. these lyrics are about life offering me so many opportunities which are at hand. my passions and determination are unbreakable. unrestrained will has brought me to this path I walk. it's the whole world... it's the whole universe I wish to conquer. it's all or nothing. my music and words I speak are unlimited. I see no boundaries for true art. here and now. here and beyond.]


4. The Nephilim Rising

[music by Nergal; lyrics by Krzysztof Azarewicz; acoustic outro by Seth]

I'm burning like a fucking fire
Mysterious Domain, Murdered Apprehension
Shemyaza, Lacifarus - glow like the Sun
in this final hour
ov Dawn ov the Dusk
I, heart ov all chthonic hearts
vulture eye, fallen one, proclaim:

this great world
is a mirror ov my small self:
striving for infinity, shall I remain?

we cannot kill the time:
it is the time that kills us
and I'm the answer on my questions
and blood ov my hopes and all prayers -
mark the sunset, the last judgment -
and my rainment... -
this is the night, just black damn'd night

as dethroned so enthroned, attracted... rejected...
in this totality is perfection ov Me in Thee
freedom ov Nature, delight ov Existence
so intoxicate me as I intoxicateth thee
slay me as I created thee
when reality is nothing more
than quantum vortex deep sleep
make it lucid dream
or hallucinate if you please
in exaltations ov All, One, None
there Is No Difference
we are the First and we are the Last
Io Pan!

[lead: Nergal]
[acoustic lead: Nergal]

[on one level ov interpretations these lyrics deal with the nephilim mythos. but there are other meanings which are more subtle and concealed between its verses, these refer to modern history and my personal experiences ov time and space. basically the idea behind this poem is that no one can easily say that some things are "above" or "below" others. who can judge this? history, human evolution, universe and existence itself is something more than a vertical line connecting human with divine. take for example Agrippa's "Three Books of Occult Philosophy": if we look closely at talismans symbolising micro- and macrocosm we will see clear similarities between them and the fact that they aren't connected vertically but more horizontally so to speak. now, everything is clear and right before our eyes...]


5. Towards Babylon

[music and lyrics by Nergal]

Leviathan!
eternally Thy powers rage within
I am reborn
purified
in the burning flames ov Sodom
by the powers ov the gods
awaken the mighty Will
that shalt carry me through eternities
Faceless One!
avenge my torment
materialise my utmost Will
beyond all legends and myths
Thou art the emmissary ov the beast
thwart the realm above
spawning might below

[backgroud lead: Nergal]

"Give us the flesh"!
"Give us the will" I command!
Dumuzi Lord
godhead immaculate!
Thou art the sun
toward the light feel no shame
Ia Asag!
forever Thou shalt remain

in victory I burn
masacrate the enemy
in battle that I hath already won
Thee I invoke
brothers ov Ariman's seed
Thou hast aroused all beings in me
come All in One
resurrected
stronger than death Thou hast become
revert my death
hail to my return
tis time to reign as a god among man

[background lead: Nergal]

"Give us the flesh"!
"Give us the will" I command!
Dumuzi Lord
godhead immaculate!
Thou art the sun

[lead: Nergal]
[lead: Seth]

Appolyon
o resplendant flame
begotten ov beyond
may I coruscate eternally
gods ov all perfection
I command - come forth!
in company ov Ur
all doubts and fears eclipsed

[once again the Elder Gods accompany me in yet another one ov life's journeys. the Ancient Ones have always been present in my life. my gods are equal to my tools by which I crush the burdens ov disbelief and ignorance. they are like vipers, who slash with their beaks the weakness ov the flesh and crippled minds. they are guardians ov my mortality, full ov vitality and beauty at the same time being cruel and merciless to all the enemies. they defend me from the plagues ov the world, cleansing it with its knowledge and purity.]


6. Before Aeons Came

[music by Nergal; lyrics by Ch. Swinburne]

before the beginning of years
there came to the making of man
time, with a gift of tears
grief, with a glass that ran

pleasure, with pain for leaven
summer, with flowers that fell
rememberance fallen from heaven
and madness risen from hell

strength without hands to smite
love that endures for a breath
night the shadow of light
and life the shadow of death

and the high gods took in hand
fire and the falling of tears
and a measure of sliding sand
from under the feet of the years

and froth and drift of the sea
and dust of the laboring earth
and bodies of things to be
in the houses of death and of birth

and wrought with weeping and laughter
and fashioned with loathing and love
with life before and after
and death beneath and above

[these lyrics are extractions from "Atlanta in Calydon" written by Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837-1909 e.v.). English lyric poet, and critic. Swinburne was viewed by his contemporary Victorians as blasphemous and depraved, but now is recognized as one ov the greatest English poets. his main topics were liberty, relations between pain and pleasure and the psychology ov sexual passion. he was pagan and in his sympathies and antitheistic. Swinburne was Crowley's primary poetic influence. the title ov this song is our invention but seems to reflect the idea behind the poem very well.]


7. Mysterium Coniunctionis (Hermanubis)

[music by Nergal; lyrics by Krzysztof Azarewicz]

sounds ov the night
are born from the stillness
censer scent ov the sun
attracts the memories
dark shades - eyes
moths - green pupils
burning echo ov your words
appears
in the heart ov possibility
in extra-real surroundings
there are my passions:
simplicity ov stars
royal Art
alkhemy ov Soul, Body, Word
and I transport
spell ov self-love I weave
and I scream
in the fumes ov antiquity
divine past
in solar room
filled with midnight hour
and midday power
inevitable, immovable
with names witch are Many
with secret meaning:
Koγζ Oμ Pαζ ON Mευω

[background lead: Nergal]

and I THINK, FEEL, and LOVE
we vibrate light
together
radiate life
on the path to City ov the Sun
angel calls out:
in mysterium coniunctionis deus est homo
and I understand the Burden
ov this journey:
I know, I will
I dare, and keep silence

[Iam facit ipse deos mittitque ad sidera numen - Manilus, Astron. IV 934]

[this song deals with very personal experiences ov occult nature I can't clearly explain to myself. life seems to be unending initiation into its mysteries and the Four Powers ov the Sphinx are the great and first ov all practical keys which open the gates to the most secret and sacred jewels ov the universe.]


8. XUL

[music and lyrics by Nergal]

the son ov morn
what made me so divine?
I, transcending ecstasy through ecstasy
I who am eternally defined by my Will

[lead: Seth]

behold I am the spawn ov downcast Ariman
awakened, yet am no longer human
kindle me to Thy rapture
as I descend into Sheol

Hiva! hear my call!
transform my flesh into flame
Hiya! hear my cry!
sustain my being in million-fold forms

[background lead: Nergal]

our creed: the living flesh
our law: trespass all the laws
since NUIT is our refuge
and HADIT becomes our light

[lead: Nergal]

all stirs within
tis chaos in and above me
in the world ov nether-nether
"I" infinite space is all-consuming

behold! I am unending!
the conciousness ov "I" shines universally
unbound by wretched dogma
I spew my will forth!
hell is democracy!

[beckground lead: Nergal]

all things exist in me
I believe in naught save myself
my sermon steadfast and proud:
there is nothing but god in me!

all things stir in me
with joy and suffering
my sermon steadfast and proud:
there is nothing but god in me!

[lead: Karl Sanders]

[this peace has a strong Lovecraftian approach to it. the term "XUL" comes from Sumerian, and means "evil". but when you read this backwards it will give you the Latin word "LUX", which is "light". in my code "evil" stands for primal forces, the cosmic beings ov unimaginable powers that influence my life, give it another dimension or different level ov reality. it is so unlimited and hard to be defined or to be labeled but it definitely opens new doors ov perception and make me understand what's hidden behind the wall ov ignorance.]


9. Slaves Shall Serve

[music by Nergal; lyrics by Krzysztof Azarewicz]

Khrevsu tvahyu gradu tore!
Khrevsu kvatro midvhu piedhvro!
Khrevsu Kristo midhvu? vhradro!
Medvro vhtrienn utrah vreghgrho

Father ov Terror!
Aba ol-Hol
enter the pylon
thru' the galleys ov past
catacombs ov night
into the starry womb

slay, slay!
Asar un-Nefer
we have no fear
our time had come
our will is done

dance, dance!
O Mighty One
in the fields ov Aqert
and spit
upon slaves ov death

War God!
trample all weakness
this is your day ov pride
draw Thy flaming sword
cut the umbilical cord
to set me free from eternal sleep

[lead: Seth]

...step by step
Khem: evolution: spiral vibration
can you hear?
can you touch?
can you see?
can you really see?

we charm all jins -
automata, inprinted realities
they creep like snakes
and all we feel
is painful bliss
as we burn forth
like winged globe
like solar disk...
...and penetrate eternity

[lead: Nergal]

Slaves shall serve!
Slaves Shall Serve!
Slaves Shall Serve!
Slaves Shall Fucking Serve!

[the title ov this song is taken from "The Book of the Law". these words invoke powers ov individuality which stands against fear and oppression ov western civilization with all its taboos, fallen religions and political idols, stupid and mad masses - "twisted mob ov Jerusalem". I wrote wrote these verses after my journey across Egypts entirety which I made in April 2004 e.v. but direct inspiration was successful invocation ov God Horus I performed in city ov Cairo on April 8th, exactly 100 years after Crowley received the text ov "The Book of the Law".]


10. The Reign Ov Shemsu-Hor

[music and lyrics by Nergal]

[Chapter I: The forbidden legacy ov a fallen race]

[instrumental]

[Chapter II: Invocation ov the watch gods]

O Mighty Watcher!
Thou art all and all art in Thee
free me from mortals
intoxicate with Thy self love
O Mighty Sentinel!
Thou art the concious one
break the monotony ov existence
that I may illuminate!

uncrowned in Tarterean Sulphur
elder than the Memphian kings
Thy reign so timeless and infinite
ever silent watchers, whom mankind yet aches to embrace
grand me Thy Promethean rays
blacker than light...
cunquering lion-headed god
by the name ov Legion dost Thou arrive

[lead: Nergal]

Thou hast seen the prophets in the desert
Thou hast bled for the fallen idols from beyond
prevailing stregth hath made Thee greater
than the god...
from amongst the million dead angels army
Azazel, begotten not ov human race
honour the divinity vision ov victorious sun
open wide your glimmering eyes
bathe in divinity ov loneliness
empowered in self creation
shine inward!
Shemyaza! the profoundest one
spread Thy wings
the desolate one
Thy disease untamed within the sinister self...

O Mighty Watcher!
Thou art all and all art in Thee
free me from mortals
intoxicate with Thy self love
O Mighty Sentinel!
Thou art the concious one
break the monotony ov existence
that I may illuminate!

[lead: Seth]

[Chapter III: The splendorous return]

[background lead: Nergal]

beyond all cowardness!
hast Thou no fear?
spit out the blasphemy!
strive unto sin...

seduce Thyself
o mighty seer!
the ancient voyager
blind me with light

the sleepless ones
in aimless andering
Thou must first fall
to reign in blasphemy...

["The Reign ov Shemsu-Hor" was inspired by Andrew Collins book "From the ashes of the angels. The forbidden legacy of a fallen race", where he reveals that fallen angels were flesh and blood members ov a race predating our own. Shemsu-Hor was a sacred society which existed in Egypt before the ancient Egyptians. it is said thay were the founders ov Egyptian culture, built the Sphinx and other megalithic monuments. Collins finds arguments that Shemsu-Hor were equal to biblical nephilims. culture's anti-heroes and fallen gods have always been very attractive to me and by its rebellious nature close to my own ethics. this is my tribute to the Fallen Ones. musically it is an enormous, three-piece epic voyage through centuries in search for a liberty, beauty and wisdom. I believe I managed to bring the Ancient's breath into that song by exporing some unique eastern guitar scales as well as using really precise orchestrations.]

2. Entering The Pylon Ov Light (Non Album Song)

Earth bedewed with seed ov death
Sheds the blood red tears
And I saw the hearth ov youth
Painfully torn out by the mighty Apep
Heart which still wants to live

Here, among the sonorous chorals
Ov mourning clothed with rain ov blood
Innocence touches the heart
But this touch penetrates only empty air
There is no life but time for a shadow
And time for a night

Mithras, Abraxas, Phallos
Serpent power, awake the dawn
Rise the pyramids ov the inmost flame
To break through
Illusions ov life and the phantoms ov death

To exist is not given to you
Oh, Asar, you are the Past One
Go and dwell among the sorrows ov Asi
Awaken I dream and see sleeping gods
And I draw the curtains ov all worlds
The veil of Isis and thou art as Persephone
Who touches the flowers ov the underworld
Yeah! I descend into the depths ov thought
To find thee in the kingdoms ov Hades
In the labyrinth ov mind
To bring thee to life, to give a form
To incarnate into the flesh
To give priceless jewels, by sages called delight
And the senses ov the earth


3. Penetration

"Seeing things in my whole life, images exploding. You have been chosen."

"We are free."

Endemion - magical son
Nothing here is real
Lasts forever
Shining like gods
New body, new blood
The fire that I feel
Armageddon
Vision

Penetrating me
Penetrating you
Penetrating deep

Look out

"What's happening is real.
You can't stop them.
What do you think, we just go on forever?"

Ziarahs are all burning ahead
Illuminating ways
I've not dreamed before
Eternals are inviting me in
I see images of you burn forever
Can't contain

Penetrating deep - generating me
Penetrating you - let go

We must go back now
Make my entrance one way
And I can't look in
And I can't look back
We cannot stop, no
Black out
Listen

[Repeat:]
"We have confirmed angel touchdown. The place is completely ablaze of fire. It's like hell down here. I think we're going straight for the fucking light."

Penetrating deep
Penetrating me
Penetrating you
Again


4. Until You Call On The Dark

[Danzig cover]

I wanna be your misery
I wanna be the world you fear
I wanna be your emptiness
I wanna be the god who kills
I wanna be the Christ who dies
Upon the fires
Of infamy
Can't you see it
Can you feel it

Until you call on the dark

Can't you see it now
How black your future will be
And every emissary that i send you
Will bleed

I wanna be your misery
I wanna be the world you fear
I wanna be the Christ who dies
Upon the fires
Of infamy
Can you see it
Can't you feel it

Until you call on the dark


5. Demigod (Live)

[Live At Sweden Rock Festival 2005]

Behold! children ov Cain
All beings not ov reptilian form
Be upon them!
Spare none! mercy cast aside!
Those who feareth not my sacred blade
Shall be blessed

Repent not!
Thou art man
God is no more
Rise now above the weakness ov flesh
Come forth! join ye the arsenals ov blasphemy
Follow the One
Who spurred Roman warring legions

Rise up! o power from sea below all seas
SIRIUS! DRACONIS!
Awake from everlasting dream!
Spirits ov abomination
Formless Thou hath appeared before me
I am before all things

Chthonic gods! those from beyond the stars
Commander ov hosts devour the flesh ov man
May their weapons melt like wax
May their tongues be torn apart
May Apophis grind their bones
May their ashes be scattered all around...

Hear me! o vermin!
How couldst Thou fall so low?
Redemption through denial
Restriction becomes a sin
Mankind! so pure...
Castrate Thy impotent god
Vomit forth the blasphemy
And forever shalt Thee win


6. Slaves Shall Serve (Live)

[Live At Sweden Rock Festival 2005]

"Slaves Shall Serve As Crowns Are Falling,
As The Apocalypse Is Nearing,
Slaves Shall Serve As Inferior Life Force,
Slaves Shall Serve As Undead Rivals"

Enter the pylon
Through the galleys ov past
Catacombs ov night
Into the starry womb

Slay, slay!

2. Slaying The Prophets Ov Isa

Ascend as empires burn
Conquistadors ov the promised land
Like the sons ov Anak
They shall rise from beyond the dawn
Rise as victorious trumpets call
Chimera, Geryon and Thee oh Sphinx!
Accompanied by Mars
Jupiter's rays in fearless eyes unrestrained

Astareth!
Bring forth the iron rain!
Hekate!
Bring forth plagues on an ever failing race!

[Lead: Nergal]

Thou shalt restore the splendor ov Sodom
Personification ov Gommorah art Thou
Iron-willed marching on ahead
With passion enraged threats torn asunder
Fill my veins with liquid iron
Armor chest and head with shining gold
That I may shake the fragile earth
May my will forever be unrestrained

Astareth!
Bring forth the iron rain!
Hekate!
Bring forth plagues on an ever failing race!

Great architect
Charlatan ov fairy tales
Thou hast failed
Since the hour bastard spawn
Who was vomited forth
From a gasping wound ov a whore
Father, forgive me not
For I have sinned
Now tremble and fear
And mercy have not upon me
Begotten son I am not
Adversary ov Thy love
The outcast ov Thy paradise
Despised...

Nemesis!
As one we stand!
Divide and conquer!
And we shall own this fuckin' earth!

[Lead: Nergal]

ELU AZIMECH!
ELU ALCHAMETH!
ELU AZIMECH!
HARIS-EL-SEMA!


3. Prometherion

Hark!
The all prophetic incantation
I was here before the beginning came
And I am the one to come after all myths and gods
Remain I shall beyond the end ov days

I pity Thee not oh self despising slave
Thy self contempt filled with disgust
Cast aside Thy scorn ov the earth
Until I lay my wrath upon the Thee I shall...

Eat the weak!
Fuck the flesh!
Slit the throat!
Consume the dead!

[Lead: Nergal]
[Lead: Seth]

Drowned in empty black
Attempt to embrace my universe
I learnt how to crawl through knives and thorns
Drowned in alienation
I drag myself through the mud
Hatred injected, abhorrence accepted
When mankind fall prey
I shall arise!

[Lead: Nergal]

And Great Dragon from my mouth emerged
And all the treasures ov this world belong to me
In the sweetest inorganic embrace ov my devotee
I pledge my dagger unto Thee

Blessed with the Promethean rain
Tranquility I may find in bottomless pits
I shall carry this darkness on my back
'Till the day all the suns eclipse I shall...

Eat the weak!
Fuck the flesh!
Slit the throat!
Consume the dead!


4. At The Left Hand Ov God

O, Serpent and Lion!
I invoke Thee!
Inside the shrine called life
By the seven wonders
By myriad mortals
That gone
And are to come
Outside!
Outside desert ov restriction
In act ov rebellion
On the sea ov motion
Stability ov matter
By serenity, strength and beauty
By the mighty chant ov every breath

In serpentine dance ov blood cells
In simplicity ov spells
Divine names, meta-games
I greet Thy presence

Oh Snake! Thou art God!
Coiled underneath my throne
With Thee I reunite
With blood we make this covenant
Myself I redefine
Look in and above:
There is more than the flesh
Look careful and Thou may see
The unextinguished flame
The nectar ov Thy rage
I taste from the cup ov fornication
And woman by my side
And scarlet is her skin
She's eager to rise
And so eager to please

Another day
Another eternity gone
And on the stairway to salvation
I walk alone among the falling stars
Looking for company
Where art Thou?
Oh, lacerate ones!

[Bass Lead: Orion]
[Lead: Nergal]
[Lead: Seth]

Arise! my sweetest friend
Or be forever fallen
We have finally arrived
From prison ov this life
To Kali's womb
Down to the earth
As angels ov almighty god-
Chaos!
'Tis our last fall
To touch our mother whore
The harlot ov the saints
That spits on the rotten cross
Incinerate the icon
The symbol ov all loss
To stand straight
At the left hand ov god

Samael! be Thou my ally!
Join me among the bright hosts
Wondering neither way ov light
Nor darkness
Ov which seed
Sprouts dispassionately
In the summer ov my life


5. Kriegsphilosophie

From long forgotten aeons
At sunrise Thou shouldst come
Desired for so fuckin' long
Ascend at my command
Surmount the sea
Throw open portals ov life
And scale this endless mountain
Ov grace and ov tears
Oh voice unspoken, mourn unheard
Abandoned heart so desolate

Rise!
Bow down before the kingless throne
When sun is yet to rise
Consume this putrid sphere!
Forever and beyond...

When heavenly chants mute
Thy apparition did I behold oh Venus, the sweetest ov them all
Let me bathe in Thy divinity
Descend! and Thou hast descended
Depart not yet!
I crave for warmth ov blissful rays
And fateless eyes encourage me
The ancient dreaming
The wolf's unchained
Disobedience has such a victorious taste...

Rise!
Bow down before the kingless throne
When sun is yet to rise
Consume this putrid sphere!
Forever and beyond...

[Lead: Nergal]
[Lead: Seth]

Forever abandoned among gods
...Since I have been made flesh,
And yet I challenge Thee!
Canst Thou hear my battle cry?

Non serviam my friends.
There are no gods beyond those made ov human flesh.
There is no more divine potential than a human potential and let this be the mightiest ov all laws!


6. Be Without Fear

[Background Lead: Nergal]

Behold the throne ov burning gold
And all the evil that it shelters
Yet I be monarch myself
Offering more than others give

Materialize the ashes ov Elysium burned
Not even angels dare to bid farewell
Annihilate this Eden now
Blasphemy gives birth to divine

Feed my flame!
Leviathan
Rape these wounds!
Asmodeus
Raise me high!
Belial
Through Thy rage my will manifests

[Lead: Seth]
[Lead: Nergal]

I truly am my own redeemer
Blindly I follow none but myself
Without fear I am
Unhallowed be my name

Myself am hell and hell I shall unleash
I laugh at Thee to scorn
Mock Thy majesty
Pour forth my chalice ov victory

Hear my call!
Leviathan
Bless my path!
Amodeus
Lift me up!
Belial
Through Thy wrath my will manifests

[Lead: Nergal]
[Lead: Seth]

Feed my flame!

Rape these wounds!

Through Thy wrath my will manifests


7. Arcana Hereticae

[Background Lead: Seth]
[Lead: Nergal]

What fool are ye!
From zenith to nadir
Through externalized purity
Dexterity
Sealed ye gates ov your own paradise
Skakti, Kali Ma, Durga Ma
Thou art pure in Thy sinistry

For those who cannot see
The Unconditioned One!
Creatrix, Matrix, Devourer!

[Lead: Seth]

Thee who spits out sun
From thy mouth
In endless momentum -
Kamala's menstruum
On road to immortality
We go against current
To the womb ov Kali
Through the mouth ov Bhairavi
To the final dawn ov Chaos
How come we're still alive?
In these kingdoms ov filth
When heaven's so abstract
And hell is so real...

[Lead: Nergal]


8. Libertheme

[Background Lead: Seth]

In my church ov disbelief
It canst get no better
When days turn from black to grey
In church ov indifference
So innocent in their guilt
Perfect in their imperfection
Let my children play

[Lead: Seth]

In my church ov liberation
When doubts and fears wither away
I stand alone vs. the world
In the church ov man
Where god is trapped in human flesh
I never pray
In church ov pain
I spoil none but myself
Yet my monologue's unheard

[Lead: Seth]

In my church ov hope
Yearning for Thy sweet embrace
The waters ov Styx I have crossed
In this church ov sulphur rain
Flaming mouth ov Sheol
In my church ov broken word
It's so little that I ask
The brightest ov the days
The darkest ov the nights

[Lead: Nergal]

What once was
I wish no longer be
Fear ov separation is no more
One cosmic breath-the whole eternity
Unbroken flow ov awareness conquers entropy

The voyager, bathed in venusian rays
Let them shine through me
Split the seas
Awake inner divinity
The flame ov awareness comes to my eyes


9. Inner Sanctum

[Background Lead: Nergal]

Split my skin, fuck my wounds
Desecrate the Inner Sanctum in which I hide
Drag me through the mud, blind my whitening eyes
That I may see darkness in the tunnels ov light

Pain I cannot deny
As I rot in this empty shell
Swamped in disaffection
Introducing to my newborn hell

Be it not so!
Thou shall see me not in agony
Failure was and is no option
'Tis my undying self
The ever wandering son ov the morn
Abandoned, yet never to be conquered

I never mourn, I never look back as long as Thy phosphoric rays
Grant me more pleasure than pain
I, who is evil can receive no good
Though I still crave, I'm yearning for
Thy healing touch ov grace...

Pain is timeless
When I question the laws ov god
Drowned in everlasting confusion
Caress my hate against the mob

Be it not so!
Thou shall see me not in agony
Failure was and is no option
'Tis my undying self
The ever wandering son ov the morn
Abandoned, yet never to be conquered
The opponent!
My life's work is complete...

Unveil the primal chaos within Thyself
Daughter ov Anu slain, Lamashtu annihilate!
Reveal to us overwhelming might
Release Thy rage destroyer ov lies

Transcending the wrath ov The Great Black
Slay the reptile!
Slay I command!

May 107 complete the cycle
When aeon ov Seth emerges
The desert storms can not be tamed
When concubine ov chaos begins her dance
Reveal to us overwhelming might
Release Thy rage destroyer ov lies


11. Christgrinding Avenue

[Lead: Nergal]

Reptile!
Spreading sickness and disease among the men
Grubby creed!
What are ye but the soulless meat?
Lunatic!
Cancer consuming Thy race from inside
Beware!
No grace awaits Thee in the crying skies above

I'm on my way
Destination hell
By the power ov will
I shall complete
The devil's work

Vultures attack!
May hell unlock overpowering might
Mourn not, my comrades!
Thou art fateless in the blinding light
Soldiers!
On the altar ov liberation crucify the whore

Rejoice!
Drink to crucifixion
For oppression is no more!

Slay the whore!
Make it bleed,
Make it weep
Let it die forever more
Slit the throat!
Let them rot
Let them pay
Let em taste their own blood
Make em crawl!
Upon this corpse
I shall feast
'Till no hope remains for the twisted mob!

Mithras!
Raise Thy sword of judgment, loose the iron rain
Beat the drum
No earthly power
May hinder nor stop Thee
Sekhmet!
Manifestation ov Mut
Protector ov Ma'at
I call upon the most divine
To spew forth this infecting dust ov life

I'm on my way
Destination hell
By the power ov will
I shall complete
The devil's work

1. Daimonos

[Music and lyrics by Nergal]

"We must never be afraid to go too far, for truth lies beyond." [Marcel Proust]

Honour me!
Chaldean priests
Bow to me, in adoration
Evangelize
Prophets ov the boundless joy
Sanctify the sin ov indulgence

We worship the sun
We worship the moon
Spreading like rats
Exalted above the stars ov god

All hail slain and risen god!
All hail Dionysus!

"Come, blessed Dionysius, various nam'd, bull-fac'd
Begot from Thunder, Bacchus fam'd
Bassarian God, of universal might
Whom swords, and blood, and sacred rage delight"

War be sustained!
My godless phoenix rise
Ne'er to lifeless shall I submit
Offering solely the sword not peace
Mercy and cowardice extinct within

We worship the sun
We worship the moon
Spreading like rats
Exalted above the stars ov god

All hail slain and risen god!
All hail Dionysus!


2. Shemaforash

[Music and lyrics by Nergal]

"What we need is hatred. From it our ideas are born." [Jean Genet]

Consumed by tongues ov fire
Burning like Phlegethon
Holy gardens reduced to ash
Extinguishing light ov hope
Bringing the end ov the days

Words ov my gospel scattered
Sacrilegious scorn spat in pale creeds
Thin is the line between pure being and pure nothing
My sole companion
Woe to Thee!

At my command:
Let the blood ov the infants flood the streets ov Bethlehem!

O ye ov little faith
With ethics rotten in a moral cage
Dead meat thrown down to the worms
To feed religious tumor
Corrupting marrow ov repugnant swirl

At my command:
Let the blood ov the infants flood the streets ov Bethlehem!
At my command:
Let the heads ov Samaritan pave my ways!

Shemhamforash!!!


3. Ov Fire And The Void

[Music and lyrics by Nergal]

"The divine is God's concern; the human, man's. My concern is neither the divine nor the human, not the true, good, just, free, etc., but solely what is mine, and it is not a general one, but is -- unique, as I am unique. Nothing is more to me than myself!" [Max Stirner]

I the Sun ov man
The offspring ov the stellar race
My halo fallen and crushed upon the earth
That I may bring balance to this world

I son ov perdition
From sheer nothingness transgressed
Unto the highest self -- to utmost freedom
To explore the starry nature ov my rage

I pulse ov existence
The law ov nature undenied
I hold the torch ov Heraclitus
So I can shake the earth and move the suns

I divine Iconoclast
Injecting chaos into my veins
With life accepted
With pain resurrected
Is the embrace ov god in man profound

The joy ov a dawn
The ecstasy ov dusk
Nourished have I this karmic flow
Where great above meets great below
Let it be written!
Let it be done!
Scattered I walk towards the fractured light


4. Transmigrating Beyond Realms Ov Amenti

[Music by Nergal; lyrics by Krzysztof Azarewicz]

"Paint me as a dead soul ...
The flesh, the image, the reflection
Let's complete the illusion"
[John Balance]

There is a flame untamed
Deep in my heart
Unyielding, pure Ain Soph
'tis measureless
Our right divine:

Aspire to all horizons
To seek nature ov things
Retreat within yourself
To find the primal breath

Slaves ov the dead gods
Martyrs ov the falsehood
Your life is death now
Engulfed by the wake ov a million years
Welcome to Amenti

To perceive means to know
To possess means to deny
In the catacombs ov life
Concealed within deaths vaults
Pure vibration lies
Nitya-samsarins
Travel to the house ov empty words
Am-Heh! devour their hearts!

Slaves ov the dead gods
Martyrs ov the falsehood
Your life is death now
Engulfed by the wake ov a million years
Welcome to Amenti

Jerusalem is falling!
Falling! falling!
Jerusalem is falling!
Yerushalaim nehereset!


5. He Who Breeds Pestilence

[Music and lyrics by Nergal]

"God is absence. God is the solitude of man." [Jean-Paul Sartre]

Inflict the seed ov Eve upon me
The heritage ov Cain can't be undone
'tis my rejection! 'tis my denial!
That stirs with repulsive mortifications
They attempted to deprive me from my odium ov chaos
They threw my wretched body into rivers ov purgatory
For such is a consequence ov my angelic nature
Abortion ov god in my leprous womb

Soiled with the miasma ov the bleakest hemisphere
The formless fires ov Amenti unfold
Not nearly as frenzy as discordia that breeds within
Not nearly as frenzy as disorder that I bring
Universe is drained
So is my heart...
...this earth grew weary and dull
Is it the renaissance ov my rigid existence?
Is there a future for me beyond the stars?

I drink to desolation
I drink to your demise
Monarch ov neglected kingdom
Oh great despiser ov life

Et credo in serpentem
Misterium mysteriorum
In nomen eius Baphomet

Hearken! my Ophities
Consume the flesh and drink the blood
Obtain communion with utmost disgrace
Reject the benefits ov eucharist
Disdain the lie!
Let you senses sharpen
Let your eyes see in the boundless dark
Resist not radiant light
Be like comets slashing through the vast skies
Be like ravening wolves
Unchaining hearts

Now drink to desolation
Drink to god's demise
Monarch ov neglected kingdom
Oh great despiser ov life

O leo et o serpens
Qui perditor perdes
Sis valens nobiscum


6. The Seed Ov I

[Music by Nergal; lyrics by Nergal and Krzysztof Azarewicz]

From the top ov the highest mountain
Prior to descent, my fall for Thee
My weapon is silence
I, bringer ov light to burn this goddamn Eden down!

Behold! I rise from primal silence
As a storm crushing dismal shores ov Acheron
My weapon is violence
From the mud ov the earth
Back to the womb ov Babalon!

Sink in the stream ov woe
Acheron!
Rise above the eyes ov god
Necromanteion!

I am the oracle
I am the grace ov god
I am the stream ov woe
I am wrath from above

From Neptunian realm arisen
Babylon the great I praised
With the voice ov silence
I called the genii ov the heights and depths

I came down as raging Mars
As volcanic fire god
Totality and I are one
In the absence ov light
Infinite I shall become

Sink in the stream ov woe
Acheron!
Rise above the eyes ov god
Necromanteion!


7. Alas, Lord Is Upon Me

[Music and lyrics by Nergal]

"Let them hate me, so that they will but fear me." [Caligula]

"Those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them
Bring them here and kill them in front of me"
[Jesus, (Luke 19:27)]

Behold! As Rome burns so do I...
'tis not the last empire to crumble
I bore witness to rise and fall ov tribes ov Adonai
And fallen short ov a glory ov god

Lord ov hosts
Whore ov salvation
Tear the skies as you spread your legs
Vomit forth upon my head
All afflictions and abominations known to man


8. Defiling Morality Ov Black God

[Music by Nergal; lyrics by Krzysztof Azarewicz and Nergal]

"I am God, and all other gods are my imagery. I gave birth to myself. I am millions of forms excreating; eternal; and nothing exists except through me; yet I am not them - they serve me."
[Austin Osman Spare]

Grant me profane kiss
Oh Isis mother ov all
Thy lips like morphine
Teasing my slumbering heart
Release me!
This cosmos is way to small
Come down on earth, evangelize!

Ravishing muse
Abduct my spirit
And bury my will
In spacious beyond
That human thought can never reach
Alight upon the earth
And consecrate my engines ov life!

And so I chant that triumph ov might
Trampling kingdoms ov conscience
I, the archangel ov wrath
With one word, the unholy sword
I overmastered every image ov god

I come in splendor and golden glory
Seeking war trophies
And sacred spoils
To purify this heart ov mine
To cast away rotten rood
Defile morality ov the blind god

Defiling morality ov black god





2. If I Were Cain

Ascending in sectarian rapture
We are an oracle ov locust
Sanguine as yet anointed
We rave the pearly gates

Walk with me, Kaiafhat
Pilate, lead the way
I call upon Cains ov this world
We are marching to the funeral ov God

Illuminate
Adoration ov murder,
Raise up the rusty knife
To pierce the heart ov your brother

Cast your stones
Lapidate me
Cursed be the Paraclete
Pour salt into my wounds
So doth Lord speaks through thy deeds

I shall redeem my spirit
Just grace my crux with sin
If you give me the nails
I'll hammer them in

Illuminate
Exploration ov darkness
I raise the rusty dagger
To pierce the eye ov JHWH

1. Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel

[music and lyrics by Nergal]

I saw the virgin's cunt spawning forth the snake
I witnessed tribes ov Judah reduced to ruin
I watched disciples twelve dissolved by flame
Looked down on son ov god snuffed in vain

Blow your trumpets Gabriel!
As I beheld the bewilderment ov Eden
Break the bread...and crumb by crumb into the Leviathan's den...
Nations fall prey
Hail my return

Hosanna Hosanna
Tribe ov Judah decimate
Hosanna Hosanna
Root ov David eradicate

Hosanna Hosanna
Let wine ov Sodom fill our mouths
Hosanna Hosanna
May Sin ov Gommorah grace our hearts


2. Furor Divinus

[music and lyrics by Nergal]

Veto! I vomited forth
From a throat choked by rope
As lunatic mob
Shackled maimed feet
Tore asunder both wings

Pluck my eyes out
Rip my tongue
Make me slave to gravity

Bleed dry ov tears
Weep with blood
Leave to atrophy

I sought reprisal high and low
I spew forth plagues to taint their soil
I crept under the shadow ov purity
In my hour ov pious wane
I turned to boundless catechism
Behold the anathema ov benediction
Sacrilege in Gethsemane manifest
Furor Divinus
Anointed sin became flesh

Emerge The accuser ov all
Hark the universe cries forlorn
Bleeds from black lungs ov hell
Deflowered by the horns

And so I reversed the wheel ov my fortune
Strike blind the eye ov the lion
With every breath stolen from their lips
I raped and raped and raped the daughters ov Zion

Raise the dagger Abraham
And slit the throat ov thy only son
Reverse the history ov man
Fuck and reset the world

Pluck my eyes out
Rip my tongue
Make me slave to gravity

Bleed dry ov tears
weep with blood
Leave my cross to atrophy


3. Messe Noire

[music by Nergal; lyrics by Nergal and Krzysztof Azarewicz]

I believe in Satan
Who rend both heavens and earth
And in the Antichrist
His dearly misbegotten
The anguish ov our future
A Bastard spawned from lie
Born ov a harlot nun
Reign high in luxury
Aloft the kings ov man

I use words sharp as a sword
To rake Saints ’shins bestrewn
Three days risen – the grand deceiver
I bless the world with ire and woe

So, can you hoard host like Zion’s coin
Belie progeny ov your pain?
IHWH, thou sayeth unto me:
Thou, disrupter, imbalance my creations!
Hence I transfix in bliss ov flagellation
I burnt in rapture, wafted ash about…
Became the law above all laws
In asymmetry ov the horns

I cut loose the cord ov li(f)e
Depart celestial source
Rub mould in holy pages
Let woodworms eat the cross
I prayed I’d die in you O Lord
I pray you’d die in me…

Who shall crucify the last prophets
And have them wilt on splintered stems?
Who shall churn hells across the earth
And reascend to seat himself…
At the left hand ov Satan
Be gaoler ov the living
…And ov the dead
As it was in the beginning
Now and shall ever be
…World without end
Amen


4. Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer

[music by Nergal; lyrics by Krzysztof Azarewicz and Nergal]

Voice ov an aeon,
Angelus Satani.
Ora pro nobis Lucifer,
You alone have suffered.

The fall and torment ov shame,
I'll smite Heaven's golden pride,
And never pity thee,
Immaculate divine.

Satan ov Elohim,
None dare to stand in your way.
Thou bow to none,
Ov Eden's feculence.

Conjure the serpent messenger,
Saviour (order in) world's decay.
Concord in temptation,
And in the fall of Eve.

For thine is the kingdom,
And the power.

For thine is the kingdom,
And the glory,
Forever.

Scholar ov the unlight,
Great volcano ov excrement,
Rippling eager to erupt,
Reconstellate the firmament.

Behold the great accuser,
A megalinga of throbbing zeal,
Raptor yearning to pierce,
To rape the seventh seal.

Destroyer ov cosmos,
Implore the ungod,
Implode the sun,
There is none wronging the serpent's cult.

Untouched and ignored,
With the serpent's might,
And the trumpets blow,
In the shadow ov the horns.

For thine is the kingdom,
And the power.

For thine is the kingdom,
And the glory,
Forever.

Lightning that stabs the heavens,
Thou quiver the mount Sinai,
Split rocks on tablets ov covenant
Listen for the tempest's rasp.

Azazel! Apolyon!
The black sun never sets,
For it never rose.

Habemus Satanas,
The Caesar's wrath.
Empire's fall,
Petition the lord with fire,
Santa Sede burns.

Phallus Dei,
Erect from pole to pole,
Viva blasfemia,
In coitus infinitus.

Hear the universe scream,
Bleeding from black holes,
Whom horns caress,
And whom God mourns.


5. Amen

[music and lyrics by Nergal]

Hail Mary, full ov disgrace
The Lord has fornicated with thee
Cursed art thou among men
And possessed

Cunning as shroud ov Turin
On the autopsy ov god
Damnata Virgo Maria
Credo undone

Bitch ov a sybilline vulva
Usurpress and liar
Witch of broken vows
Centuries wept because ov thee…
Where art thou now in the hour ov trial?!?

Cunning as shroud ov Turin
On the autopsy ov god
Creatio ex nihilo
Credo undone

Wretched is the fruit ov thy womb, Babylon!
Holy mother, mother ov god
Pray for us not, the sinners
Now and at the hour ov our death
Amen


6. The Satanist

[music and lyrics by Nergal]

I descended from the Mount Sinai
Unleashed the splendour upon a scroundel mob
To shelter where no messianic light
Drove one single ray into the pulp ov life
O sweet Salome I beckon thee
Bring forth thy heinous offering
Without your love
So incomplete
Corrupt me with your dignity

I decompose in rapture ov hells
Dissolve divide disintegrate
I am yours
In euphoria below

At faintest whim they would impale the sun
And thus the sheep in me became the wolf in man
I am the fly that flew forth from the ark
My thoughts like insects
Whoring wounds divine
Been bored with cosmos my dear old foe
This universe has never been enough
Compelled to liberate the spring ov life
When the levee breaks gush forth o’ stream ov ice

I decompose in rapture ov hells
Dissolve divide disintegrate
I am yours
In euphoria below

I cast my halo from perdition’s clay
Behold my bliss profane
Born ov a lie
Condemned to lurk
Live in denial
Yet coiled aflame…

I am the great rebellion
Neath Milton’s tomb I dwell
An existence even sin would not pardon
No guilt, no reason, saviour, or shame


7. Ben Sahar

[music and lyrics by Nergal]

Thee I cast aside
Fetus divine
Agnus dei
Free ov thy lies

Hearken hosts on high
Fetch me your god
As my ambition prescribes
Challenge the sun
Ascend shall I unto the heavens
Exalt my throne above his celestial display
Sit shall I upon that mount ov congregation
Far toward the north

Hearken dogs ov Nazarene
Linger at St. Peter’s door
Partake from the well ov nothingness
Bite the withered hand ov god
Ascend shall I unto the heavens
Exalt my throne above his celestial display
Sit shall I upon that mount ov congregation
Far toward the north

Boreal hell beneath my feet
Blistering Eden above
With prayer on lips
With freedom bequeathed
Thru fire we walk
With fire in hearts!


8. In The Absence Ov Light

[music and lyrics by Nergal]

Every seme the Devil breathes
My steps never outweighed the gravity ov hell
So I keep praying for rain ov flaming rocks
To foster the symmetry ov worlds

I had a vision ov the impenetrable darkness
Never found on neither side ov the moon
It wields composure ov my soul
That comes as one with the odium below

Chant the psalm
Non serviam
Retrieve the pride
Within and without

[Spoken part translated]
I throw out each flaw, any idea.
I trust not any abstraction.
I believe not in god nor mind…
enough with these gods.
Give me a human.
Let him be just like me, just like me…
Dull, unripe, unfinished, not dark, and not bright.
So that I may with him dance, play with him,
with him fight, in front of him pretend,
give him thanks, and him, rape...
fall in love with him, through him recreate myself,
grow through him, and sprouting this way,
wed myself, in the church ov man
[End of spoken part]

I imagined the most ardent ray ov sun
Like vulture hovering above my neck
It burns with fever deep within my soul
Erect in glory to sink into shame

Oh lord, whence came this doubt?
Thou doth know I am all and everything
Let loose my shackles
Let chaos reign
Infecting moral arteries...

Chant the psalm
Non serviam
Retrieve the pride
Within and without


9. O Father O Satan O Sun!

[music and lyrics by Nergal]

Akephalos
Shine thru me
Come forth in war
Come forth in peace

Bring down the sun
Extinguish all the stars
Let me remain
In splendor ov thy light

Bornless One
As darkness bright
Found not in tongues
Found not in light

Bring down the rain
Drain waters ov Styx
Faustian luminary
Redeem
Blaspheme

Like a day without the dawn
Like a ray void ov the sun
Like a storm that brings no calm
I'm most complete yet so undone

Agathos Daimon
Ov plague and fever
Thy name is nowhere
Thy name is never

Liberate me
Ignite the seeds
Bind not to guilt
Ignis Gehennalis

O Father
O Satan
O Sun
Let the children come to thee
Behold the morning star

Akephalos
Shine thru me
Come forth in war
Come forth in peace

Like a day without the dawn
Like a ray void ov the sun
Like a storm that brings no calm
I'm most complete yet so undone

O Lion-Serpent Sun, The beast that whirlest forth,
a thunder-bolt, begetter of life!
Thou that flowest! Thou that goest!
Thou Satan-Sun, Hadith, that goest without will!
Thou Air! Breath! Spirit! Thou without bound or bond!
Thou essence, air swift-streaming, elasticity!
Thou wanderer, father of all!
Thou wanderer, spirit of all!

Hear me, and make all spirits subjects unto me;
so that every spirit of the firmament and of the ether,
upon the earth and under the earth,
on dry land and in the water
of whirling air, and of rushing fire,
and every spell and scourge of god
may be obedient unto me.

Thou spiritual sun! Satan, thou eye, thou lust!
Cry aloud! Cry aloud!
Whirl the wheel, O my Father, O Satan, O Sun!

1. Nieboga Czarny Xiądz

[Track recorded during "The Satanist" sessions.]

The hearts ov man stand open
'Tis harvest ov my gospel
Ignite phosphorus seeds
Bleed Prometheus, bleed!

Rua Elohim!
And the heavens trembled as I fell from above
No grace, no glory, no bliss from beyond
O how I miss fertile rays ov Sun

Upadłem na Twe podobieństwo
Ja karzeł niebios
Babilon i wilk.
Winem rynsztoka spity jak pies
Ciemniejszej strony księżyca Syn

The hearts ov man stand open
'Tis harvest ov my gospel
Ignite phosphorus seeds
Bleed Prometheus, bleed!

Emerge I shall
From vessel ov the broken heart
Who am I?
Twixt chaos and god - a deathless tie

Rua Qadosh!
And the holy whore swept me up from her cunt
Licking my wounds I craved the blood
Stranded with naught but pain and lies

Ja duch sprzeczności
Ze światem walczę
By zrzucić jarzmo niewoli
Przeklęta niech będzie Golgota
I owoc marności Twojej - Syn Boży!


2. Moonspell Rites

From the dark ancient temples
Horrible palaces
From the land of dark forests
Kingdom of snow and frost
Where true evil dwells
Where flames are spiritual food
Where black satanic holocaust strikes
And people are baptized in blood
I come with the northern winds
I remain true, closed in icy heart

Moonspell rites [2x]

Cold, I'm standing in the moonlight
Demons return to me every night
Fill my soul with sacred power
Mystical whispers resound with hallow echo
Spread out my hands
Cold north majesty rises
Unsilent winds strike this pagan landscape
Where gods sit high on the oaken thrones

Moonspell rites [2x]

[Solo]

Moonspell rites [2x]

I'm the dark warrior, presented in flames
Carried on the hellish wings of fire
I discover the deepest desires, feel delight
I destroy all the god's laws
I am almighty immortal power


3. Towards The Dying Sun We March

[Track recorded during the "Evangelion" sessions.]

From the blood of the earth
From its sacred soil
That alters a spell
Contorting with the stars of revenge
Come forth, martyrs of the underworld!

Blessed, but thou are not!
Cruel godhead, thy child, and in the world for so long
Its expression I draw out and march towards the sun
Unleashing force
Can't stop me now!

Born of the seas
The setting tides confine reality
Between future ov the living, perdition I dwell
Anointed by blissful hypocria that never ends!

In unyielding expression of selflessness
Where I dare to challenge thy gravity
Thus, speaks the nature of my ways
Thus, the true light illuminates!

Here lie limitless sins ov eminence
Where valiant boats implode, drifts the world netherwards
Standing with face of hell, lest we flog what's crucified
I shall layeth with my soul to rest, until I reach the sun's might!
