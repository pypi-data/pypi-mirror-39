# Design
# ======
#
# Normal commands like `execute` wait on the `_wait_for` method.  This method creates a new
# Future for each call and waits on it before returning.  A reader or writer is added to the
# libpq socket that completes the future.  When `_wait_for` wakes up from the future it removes
# the reader and writer.
#
# This is designed for executing a single command at a time.  Since the methods are designed
# for "yield from" this should be fine.
#
# Notifications, however, require a reader to be attached at all times.  If it is possible for
# the reader/writer callback to determine if it was triggered due to notifications or not,
# notifications and execute could be mixed.  In the current design, a connection can either be
# used for executing or listening.
