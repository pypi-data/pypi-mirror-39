# mkdocs-minify-plugin

This is a MkDocs plugin that minifies a page's HTML prior to being written to disk.

## Setup

Install the plugin using pip:

`pip install mkdocs-minify-plugin`

Activate the plugin in `mkdocs.yml`:
```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - minify-plugin
```

> **Note:** If you have no `plugins` entry in your config file yet, you'll likely also want to add the `search` plugin. MkDocs enables it by default if there is no `plugins` entry set, but now you have to enable it explicitly.

More information about plugins in the [MkDocs documentation][mkdocs-plugins].
