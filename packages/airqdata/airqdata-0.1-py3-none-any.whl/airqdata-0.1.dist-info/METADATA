A toolkit to retrieve, analyze and visualize data from a variety of air quality
sensors.

The scripts include tools to  
* wrap the APIs of various data providers, including Civic Lab Brussels'
[InfluencAir](https://influencair.be/) project, the
[luftdaten.info](https://luftdaten.info/) project,
[madavi.de](https://www.madavi.de/ok-lab-stuttgart/) and
[irceline.be](http://www.irceline.be/en)  
* represent sensors of those different providers as objects with a unified
  interface to make it easy to interact with them  
* retrieve sensor measurement data through API calls  
* cache those data  
* clean and combine the data  
* describe measurements statistically - individual sensors or groups to
  compare  
* plot measurement time series  
* find sensors that are geographically close to a point of interest or to other
  sensors  

For usage examples, see the

notebook.

## Requirements
A Python 3.5+ environment is assumed. Several Python packages are required, see
requirements.txt. To install them, use Python's pip command or execute
install_requirements.sh, with elevated privileges
(`sudo ./install_requirements.sh`) if needed on your system.
