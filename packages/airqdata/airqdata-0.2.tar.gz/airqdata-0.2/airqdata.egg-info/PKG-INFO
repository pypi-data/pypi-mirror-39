Description: # Air quality data
        
        A toolkit to retrieve, analyze and visualize data from a variety of air quality
        sensors.
        
        The scripts include tools to  
        * wrap the APIs of various data providers, including Civic Lab Brussels'
        [InfluencAir] project, the [luftdaten.info] project, [madavi.de] and
        [irceline.be]  
        * represent sensors of those different providers as objects with a unified
          interface to make it easy to interact with them  
        * retrieve sensor measurement data through API calls  
        * cache those data  
        * clean and combine the data  
        * describe measurements statistically - individual sensors or groups to
          compare  
        * plot measurement time series  
        * find sensors that are geographically close to a point of interest or to other
          sensors  
        
        For usage examples, see the [demo] notebook.
        
        ## Installation
        To install airqdata from PyPI, run  
        `pip install airqdata`
        
        A Python 3.5+ environment and several Python packages are required. When
        installing airqdata with pip, those dependencies will be installed
        automatically. Otherwise see requirements.txt and
        install_requirements.sh in this repository.
