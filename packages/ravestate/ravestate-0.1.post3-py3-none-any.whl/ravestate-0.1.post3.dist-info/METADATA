## About

Ravestate is a reactive library for real-time natural language dialog systems.

## Dependencies

### portaudio on macOS

In order to install PyAudio with pip, you need to install portaudio first using:

`brew install portaudio`

## Installation

### Via PIP

The easiest way to install ravestate is through pip:

``
pip install ravestate
``

### For developers

First, install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# To run tests, install pytest, mocking, fixtures...
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Then, you may open the repository in any IDE, and mark the
`modules` folder as a sources root. 

## Running Hello World

Ravestate applications are defined by a configuration,
which specifies the ravestate modules that should be loaded.

To run the basic hello world application, run ravestate
with a config file or command line arguments:

### Running with command line spec

You can easily run a combination of ravestate modules in a shared context,
by listing them as arguments to the `rasta` command, which is installed
with ravestate:

```bash
rasta ravestate_conio ravestate_hello_world
```

Run `rasta -h` to see more options!

### Running with config file(s) 

You may specify a series of config files to configure ravestate context,
when specifying everything through the command line becomes too laborious:

```yaml
# In file hello_world.yml
module: core
config:
  import:
    - ravestate_conio
    - ravestate_hello_world
```
Then, run `rasta` with this config file:

```bash
rasta -f hello_world.yml
```

## Running tests

If you have installed the dependencies from ``requirements-dev.txt`` you
may run the ravestate test suite as follows:

``
./run_tests.sh
``
