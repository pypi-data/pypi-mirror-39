Description: 
        Matomo distribution manager
        ===========================
        
        A command-line tool for building Matomo distributions with plugins bundled in 
        and various customizations applied. It builds a bundled zip file in a 
        verifiable and reproducible manner for use with systems like Docker.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - **Version pining**
          Whilst a range of accepted versions may be specified in the 
          `distribution.toml`, the lock file that is used to produce the bundle fixes 
          an exact version ensuring that subsequent runs will always download the same 
          release.
        - **Download hash pining**
          We apply a trust-on-first-download mode for all files, such that any 
          change in file hash for the same version can only be rectified through manual 
          intervention. This pinning also ensures a consistent input into the 
          customization stages
        - **Useful tweaks**
          Remove modules that serve no purpose under your intended release scheme such 
          as the marketplace.
        - **Tidy bundle**
          Bundles can optionally have packaging information(think `package.json` and 
          `.composer.lock`), example plugins and other supporting file removed to 
          keep the bundle size down.
        - **Safe & shareable caching**
          Source zip files are cached locally for faster subsequent builds. Caches can 
          be shared across distributions, and each file has it's integrity checked 
          against the expected hashes stored in the distribution's lock file.
