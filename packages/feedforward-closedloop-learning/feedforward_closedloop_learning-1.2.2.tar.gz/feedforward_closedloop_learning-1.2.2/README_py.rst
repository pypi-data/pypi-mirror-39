Feedforward closed loop learning library/API
============================================

The documentation of all functions can be obtained with::
  
    import feedforward_closedloop_learning as fcl
    help(fcl)

The API is identical to the C++ API: The header files `fcl.h`,
`neuron.h` and `layer.h` contain docstrings for
all important calls:
https://github.com/glasgowneuro/feedforward_closedloop_learning

The detailed documentation can be generated with doxygen.

The best way to get started is to look at the script
in `tests_py`:
https://github.com/glasgowneuro/feedforward_closedloop_learning/tree/master/tests_py

A full application using the Python API is our vizdoom
agent:
