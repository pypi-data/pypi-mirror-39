This module houses the generation class that uses the pyphenomd package to generate snr data in parallel. It is part of the BOWIE analysis tool. Author: Michael Katz. Please cite "Evaluating Black Hole Detectability with LISA" (arXiv:1807.02511) for usage of this code.

PhenomD waveforms are generated according to Husa et al 2016 (arXiv:1508.07250) and Khan et al 2016 (arXiv:1508.07253). Please cite these papers if the PhenomD waveform is used.

		Class that carries all of the binaries and calls the methods from PhenomDWaveforms, including SNRCalculation.

		PhenomDWaveforms is a class that takes binary parameters as inputs, and returns characteristic strain waveforms.

		Inputs:

			:param m1: (float) - 1D array  - mass 1 in Solar Masses. (>0.0)
			:param m2: (float) - 1D array - mass 2 in Solar Masses. (>0.0)

			:param chi1: (float) - 1D array - dimensionless spin of mass 1 aligned to orbital angular momentum. [-1.0, 1.0]
			:param chi1: (float) - 1D array - dimensionless spin of mass 2 aligned to orbital angular momentum. [-1.0, 1.0]

			:param z_or_dist: (float) - 1D array - a measure of distance to the binary. This can take three forms: redshift (dimensionless) (default), luminosity distance (Mpc), comoving_distance (Mpc). The type used must be specified in 'dist_type' parameter. (>0.0)

			:param st: (float) - 1D array - start time of waveform in years before end of the merger phase. This is determined using 1 PN order. (>0.0)

			:param et: (float) - 1D array - end time of waveform in years before end of the merger phase. This is determined using 1 PN order. (>=0.0)

			:param extra_dict: (dict) - carries extra kwargs for waveform generation and snr calculation. Keys and Values:

				dist_type: (str) - which type of distance is used. Default is 'redshift'. Needs to be 'redshift', 'luminosity_distance', or 'comoving_distance'.

				dist_unit: (str) - the unit of distance. Needs to Mpc or Gpc.

				num_points: (int) - scalar - number of points to use in the waveform. The frequency points are log-spaced. Default is 8192.

				averaging_factor: (float) - scalar - factor applied to the amplitudes of the binaries averaging over sky location, orientation, and polarization.

				snr_factor: (float) - factor to multipy the final snr by. For LISA, this is sqrt(2) due to 6-link configuration.
