        TorchGAN is a [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org) based framework for designing and developing Generative Adversarial Networks. This framework has been designed to provide building blocks for popular GANs and also to allow customization for cutting edge research. Using TorchGAN's modular structure allows
        
        * Trying out popular GAN models on your dataset.
        * Plug in your new Loss Function, new Architecture, etc. with the traditional ones.
        * Seamlessly visualize the training with a variety of logging backends.
        
        ### Installation
        
        Using pip (for stable release):
        
        ```bash
          $ pip3 install torchgan
        ```
        
        Using pip (for latest master):
        
        ```bash
          $ pip3 install git+https://github.com/torchgan/torchgan.git
        ```
        
        From source:
        
        ```bash
          $ git clone https://github.com/torchgan/torchgan.git
          $ cd torchgan
          $ python setup.py install
        ```
