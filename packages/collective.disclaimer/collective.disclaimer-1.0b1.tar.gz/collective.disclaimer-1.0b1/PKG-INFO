        ===========
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this package in a buildout-based installation:
        
        Edit your buildout.cfg and add the following to it:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.disclaimer
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to 'Disclaimer' and click the 'Activate' button.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        After installing the package,
        go to the 'Disclaimer' configlet on 'Site Setup' and enable the feature.
        
        .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collective/disclaimer/master/docs/configlet.png
            :align: center
            :height: 900px
            :width: 800px
        
            The Disclaimer control panel configlet.
        
        Now, the first time a user visits the site the disclaimer will be shown at the bottom of the page.
        
        .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collective/disclaimer/master/docs/viewlet.png
            :align: center
            :height: 600px
            :width: 800px
        
            The Disclaimer viewlet at work.
        
        Users will see the disclaimer again whenever information in the configlet is updated.
        
        How Does It Work?
        -----------------
        
        This package registers a new viewlet on ``plone.portalfooter`` viewlet manager.
        The viewlet is normally hidden and it will only be shown after checking the user hasn't seen it yet.
        The information on last time the viewlet was updated is stored in the user's browser local storage.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0b1 (2018-12-08)
        ------------------
        
        - Register the controlpanel for any context.
          The correct registry is automatically acquired.
          This way, it's possible to set different disclaimer texts in a Lineage site with lineage.registry installed.
          [thet]
        
        - Add a ``disclaimer-inner`` wrapper to allow easier styling, e.g. positioning the viewlet centered on the website and darkening the whole background.
          [thet]
        
        - Move styles and scripts into the viewlet, so that they are included when using Diazo and just using the viewlet selector to copy the viewlet into the theme.
          [thet]
        
        - Add an "OK" button instead of the close link.
          When the button is hit, the viewlet is closed and the storage key is set.
          Previously the storage key was immediately set even without using the "close" link.
          [thet]
        
        - Fix translation of default values on configlet (HT @fredvd).
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Fix style of hover and visited links inside disclaimer viewlet.
