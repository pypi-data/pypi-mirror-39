Description: This package contains code generators to facilitate the development of Zope[2]
        applications.

        Modules
        =======
        
        constructor
        ===========
        
        This module contains factories for the generation of add form and
        add action for ``OFS.PropertyManager.PropertyManager`` based classes.
        The generated functions are usually used as constructors in ``registerClass``
        calls during product initialization. The subpackage ``test`` contains an
        example (also used for testing this product).
        
        The class' ``_properties`` attribute and the associated default values
        are used for add form generation.
        
        The module tries hard to avoid encoding problems. Its functions
        need to handle up to 3 encodings: the encoding used for the code,
        the encoding used for non unicode properties and unicode properties.
        The browser can only handle a single encoding per page. Therefore,
        the module must use a single encoding and all other encodings must
        be mapped. The module uses ``utf-8`` as this unified encoding.
        The module does nothing special with strings from code. The page template
        will convert it to unicode in its standard way. Use unicode strings,
        if this gives not the expected result. Unicode based properties
        are passed on unchanged to the template. ``str`` based properties
        are mapped to unicode with a charset that is either explicitely specified,
        looked up in the current acquisition context under the name
        ``management_page_charset`` and falls back to ``ZPublisher.default_encoding``.
        The form action converts values for those properties back to ``str``
        using the same charset.
        
        
        add_form_factory
        ----------------
        
        This factory generates an add form for an
        ``OFS.PropertyManager.PropertyManager`` subclass.
        It has the following parameters.
        
        
          =============  ===========================             ======================================
          name           default                                 description
          =============  ===========================             ======================================
          *class_*                                               the class to generate the form for
          *action*       ``add_``\ *classname*                   the forms action
          *description*  *class_*\ ``.__doc__``                  the documentation shown in the form
          *charset*      see above                  
          *template*     package provided                        the template to generate the form
          =============  ===========================             ======================================
        
        The template it brought into the acquisition context of the
        generated functions argument and then called with the
        keyword parameters ``charset``,
        ``meta_type``, ``description``, ``action``, ``properties``
        and ``class_``. The call should return the HTML
        form representation. The package provided template works well
        together with the add action created by the add action factory.
        
        When you plan to customize the template, please take a look
        at the package provided template and the docstring in the source
        as this page does not describe all details.
        
        Due to a bug/weakness, Zope's property management
        page handles unicode properties only correctly
        when it can use the utf-8 charset.
        Therefore, it is highly recommended to use utf-8 consistently.
        Otherwise, it is possible that property values set with functions
        of this module cannot be reliably edited later.
        Note in addition, that Zope's property management spells the
        utf-8 charset (stupidly) as ``UTF-8`` (note the upper case).
        Therefore, use ``UFT-8`` rather than ``utf-8`` when you specify
        the utf-8 charset for your ``management_page_charset``.
        
        
        add_action_factory
        ------------------
        
        This factory generates an add action for an
        ``OFS.PropertyManager.PropertyManager`` subclass.
        The generated action creates an instance of this class, sets its properties,
        adds it as content object of its first parameter (assumed to be
        an ``OFS.ObjectManager.ObjectManager``) and optionally calls
        a hook. Then, it either returns the created instance or redirects
        to its management interface.
        
        The factory has the parameters *class_* and the optional *hook*.
        
        The generated action has the parameters *id* and the
        optional *props* and *REQUEST*.
        
        *props* specifies property values
        for the created instance. If not specified and *REQUEST* is passed,
        it defaults to ``REQUEST.form``. If specified, it must be a mapping.
        If the property value mapping lacks values for some properties, these
        retain their default values; values for undefined properties are silently
        ignored.
