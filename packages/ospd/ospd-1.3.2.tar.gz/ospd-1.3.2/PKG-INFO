Description: About OSPD
        ----------
        
        OSPD is a base class for scanner wrappers which share the same communication
        protocol: OSP (Open Scanner Protocol). OSP creates a unified interface for
        different security scanners and makes their control flow and scan results
        consistently available under the central Greenbone Vulnerability Manager service.
        
        OSP is similar in many ways to GMP (Greenbone Management Protocol): XML-based,
        stateless and non-permanent connection.
        
        The design supports wrapping arbitrary scanners with same protocol OSP,
        sharing the core daemon options while adding scanner specific parameters and
        options.

        How to install OSPD?
        --------------------
        
        You can install ospd from the Python Package Index using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/):
        
            pip install ospd
        
        How to write your own OSP Scanner Wrapper
        -----------------------------------------
        
        As a core you need to derive from the class OSPDaemon from ospd.py.
        See the documentation there for the single steps to establish the
        full wrapper.
        
        See the file doc/INSTALL-ospd-scanner about how to register a OSP scanner at
        the Greenbone Vulnerability Manager which will automatically establish a full
        GUI integration for the Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA).
