Description: ## pyMediaAnnotator
        #### A GTK+ and vlc based application for annotating video and audio files for classification tasks
        
        [![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/aalok-sathe/pyMediaAnnotator/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/aalok-sathe/pyMediaAnnotator/commits/master)
        
        
        ### Features:
        - Add text annotations time-locked to content in media file
        - Annotate time accurate to the millisecond
        - Jump to annotation start time to verify correctness
        - Standard media playback features (play/pause, stop, seek)
        - Change annotation task mid-video
        - Edit annotation label for particular time segment
        - Delete annotation entry
        - Undo annotation segment (in the order of most recent)
        - Sort annotations by starttime by clicking on column header so that you can go back and re-annotate a particular segment of media
        
        ### Planned features and bugfixes for future releases:
        - The YAML format was chosen because it is convenient and human-readable. However, in the future, the user should be able to choose output format (`json`, `pickle`, `txt`, Numpy array, etc.)
        - Fix seek bar synchronization with playback
        - Multiple button support for rapid multiclass annotation
        - Save and resume existing annotation
        
        ### Installation:
        - Clone the repository (recommended: ssh)
            - ssh: `git clone git@gitlab.com:aalok-sathe/pyMediaAnnotator.git`
            - https: `git clone https://gitlab.com/aalok-sathe/pyMediaAnnotator.git`
        - Make sure to have the necessary prerequisites:
            - `pyGTK/pyGTK/pyGObject`: Python GTK bindings
            - `vlc`, `python-vlc`: the VLC media player and Python bindings for `libvlc`
        - Use makefile to create Python package and install:
            - `make build`
            - `python3 setup.py install [--user]`
        
        ### Usage:
        - Start application with the executable: `./pyMediaAnnotator`
        - Screenshot: ![example usage to annotate the presence of laugh track in an episode of Friends](scrsht-friends.png?raw=true Screenshot")
