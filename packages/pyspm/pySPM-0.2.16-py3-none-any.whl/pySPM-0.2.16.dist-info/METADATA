pySPM
=====

pySPM is a python library (python3, but should be compatible with
python2) in order to read, handle and plot Scanning Probe Microscopy
(SPM) images as well as ToF-SIMS data.

For now it support the following formats:
- Nanoscan .xml file format
- Bruker
- Iontof ToF-SIMS fileformats:
  - ITA
  - ITM
  - ITS
  - ITAX
- Nanonis SXM file

Important
---------

This library is offered as it is and is still in development. Please
note that reading the raw data was done by reverse engineering and
guessing and not with a manual as the file format is proprietary. It
seems to work well with the data used by the developer of this library,
but there is **NO GUARANTY** that this library will work correctly with
your own specific data.

If you find bugs and issues, please report them to the developer:
https://github.com/scholi/pySPM/issues
