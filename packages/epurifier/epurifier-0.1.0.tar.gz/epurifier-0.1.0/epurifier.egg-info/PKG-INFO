Description: # Email Purifier
        
        A KISS(Keep It Stupid Simple) email validator for csv files
        
        To validate and store the emails in a csv file run:
        
        ```bash
        python csv_checker.py <input file> <output file>
        ```
        
        And tackle with the invalid emails through keyboard.
        
        
        > Note that both input and Output files should be in csv format
        
        
        Also, to extend the valid emails you can either pass them when you create the EmailPurifier class as
        ```python
        import email_checker as ec
        emails_to_check = [
            # Your emails
        ]
        additional_valid_emails = [
            # add only domain names such as 'google.com'
        ]
        emil = ec.EmailPurifier(emails_to_check, additional_valid_emails)
        ```
        
        By default it adds the passed additional emails to a list of top 10 valid emails present in `valid_emails.py`
        If for some reason you want to only use the additional emails and don't want emails from `valid_emails` you can pass the argument `onlyAdditional=True` to override the behavior.
