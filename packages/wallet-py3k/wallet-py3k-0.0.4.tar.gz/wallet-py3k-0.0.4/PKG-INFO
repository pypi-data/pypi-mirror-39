Description: # Wallet-py3k
        
        Python library to read/write [Apple Wallet](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/PassKit_PG/Chapters/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012195-CH1-SW1) (.pkpass) files
        
        This is a fork of https://github.com/devartis/passbook which doesn't support py3k.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        1. Get a Pass Type Id
        
           Visit the iOS Provisioning Portal -> Pass Type IDs -> New Pass Type ID
           Select pass type id -> Configure (Follow steps and download generated pass.cer file)
           Use Keychain tool to export a Certificates.p12 file (need Apple Root Certificate installed)
        
        2. Generate the necessary certificate and key .pem files
        
           ```sh
           openssl pkcs12 -in "Certificates.p12" -clcerts -nokeys -out certificate.pem
           openssl pkcs12 -in "Certificates.p12" -nocerts -out key.pem
           ```
        
        ## Typical Usage
        
        ```python
            from wallet.models import Pass, Barcode, StoreCard
        
            cardInfo = StoreCard()
            cardInfo.addPrimaryField('name', 'John Doe', 'Name')
        
            organizationName = 'Your organization'
            passTypeIdentifier = 'pass.com.your.organization'
            teamIdentifier = 'AGK5BZEN3E'
        
            passfile = Pass(cardInfo, \
                passTypeIdentifier=passTypeIdentifier, \
                organizationName=organizationName, \
                teamIdentifier=teamIdentifier)
        
            passfile.serialNumber = '1234567'
            passfile.barcode = Barcode(message = 'Barcode message')
        
            # Including the icon and logo is necessary for the passbook to be valid.
            passfile.addFile('icon.png', open('images/icon.png', 'rb'))
            passfile.addFile('logo.png', open('images/logo.png', 'rb'))
            passfile.create('certificate.pem', 'key.pem', 'wwdr.pem', '123456', 'test.pkpass') # Create and output the Passbook file (.pkpass)
        ```
        ## Note: Getting WWDR Certificate
        
        Certificate is available @ http://developer.apple.com/certificationauthority/AppleWWDRCA.cer
        It can be exported from KeyChain into a .pem (e.g. wwdr.pem)
