        Robocrystallographer is a tool to generate text descriptions of crystal
        structures. Similar to how a real-life crystallographer would analyse a
        structure, robocrystallographer looks at the symmetry, local environment, and
        extended connectivity when generating a description. The package includes
        utilities for identifying molecule names, component orientations,
        heterostructure information, and more...
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Robocrystallographer can be used from the command-line or from a python API.
        The package integrates with the `Materials Project <https://materialsproject.org>`_
        to for allow generation of structure descriptions directly from materials project
        ids. For example, to generate the description of SnO :sub:`2` (mp-856_), one
        can simply run:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            robocrystallographer mp-856
        
        Alternatively, a structure file can be specified in place of an mp-id.
        Robocrystallographer supports the same file formats as pymatgen_, including
        the Crystallographic Information Format (CIF), and common electronic structure
        package formats such as POSCAR.
        
        Python Interface
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        The two core classes in robocrystallographer are:
        
        - ``StructureCondenser``: to condense the structure into an intermediate JSON
          representation.
        - ``StructureDescriber``: to turn the condensed structure into a text description.
        
        The format of the intermediate JSON representation is detailed on the
        `Condensed Structure Format page <https://google.com>`_ page.
        A minimal working example for generating text descriptions is simply:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from robocrys import StructureCondenser, StructureDescriber
        
            condenser = StructureCondenser()
            describer = StructureDescriber()
            condensed_structure = condenser.condense_structure(structure)
            description = describer.describe(condensed_structure)
        
        Both classes have many options for customising the output of the structure
        descriptions. More information is provided in the `Module Documentation page
        <http://google.com>`_.
        
        Example Output
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        An example of the output generated by robocrystallographer for SnO :sub:`2`
        (mp-856_) is given below:
        
           SnO2 is Rutile structured and crystallizes in the tetragonal P4_2/mnm space
           group. The structure is three-dimensional. Sn(1) is bonded to six equivalent
           O(1) atoms to form a mixture of edge and corner-sharing SnO6 octahedra. The
           corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 51°. All Sn(1)–O(1) bond lengths
           are 2.09 Å. O(1) is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent
           Sn(1) atoms.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Robocrystallographer can be installed using pip:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install robocrystallographer
        
        Robocrystallographer requires Python 3.5+. The `OpenBabel
        <http://openbabel.org/wiki/Python>`_ package is required to determine molecule
        names. This is an optional requirement but its use is recommended for best
        results. If you are using the `Conda <https://conda.io/>`_ package management
        system, OpenBabel can be installed using:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            conda install -c openbabel openbabel
        
        More information is available `here <https://anaconda.org/openbabel/openbabel>`__.
