    Class implementing the ZooKeeper interface.

    This class uses the facade design pattern to keep common interaction
    with the ZooKeeper API simple and consistent for the caller, and
    limits coupling between objects. It allows for more complex interactions
    by providing direct access to the client connection when needed (though
    that is discouraged). It also provides for a convenient entry point for
    testing only ZooKeeper interactions.
