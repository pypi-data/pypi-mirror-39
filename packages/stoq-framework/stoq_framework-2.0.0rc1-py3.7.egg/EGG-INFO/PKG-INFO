        # Overview
        
        stoQ is a automation framework that helps to simplify the more mundane and
        repetitive tasks an analyst is required to do. It allows analysts and
        DevSecOps teams the ability to quickly transition from different data sources,
        databases, decoders/encoders, and numerous other tasks. stoQ was designed to be
        enterprise ready and scalable, while also being lean enough for individual security
        researchers.
