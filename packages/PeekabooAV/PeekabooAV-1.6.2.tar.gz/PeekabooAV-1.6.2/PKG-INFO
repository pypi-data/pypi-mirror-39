        Clone the repository
        ```shell
        git clone https://github.com/scVENUS/PeekabooAV.git
        ```
        
        Install dependencies

        ```
        
        Install PeekabooAV
        ```shell
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ### Configuration ###
        Take a look at ``peekaboo.conf.sample`` and ``ruleset.conf.sample``.
        
        
        ## Running the tests ##
        
        Runs the unit tests
        ```shell
        python test.py 
        ```
        
        
        ## Usage ##
        
        Now, you can run PeekabooAV with
        ```shell
        peekaboo -c /path/to/your/peekaboo.conf
        ```
        
        **Note:** If you have your PeekabooAV configuration file named ``peekaboo.conf``
        and put it in the base directory of the repository you can omit the ``-c`` option.  
        Also, for detailed command line options run
        ```shell
        peekaboo --help
        ```
        
        ### Usage without Installation ###
        
        You can now run PeekabooAV without installing it using the ``peekaboo_debug.py`` script.
        ```shell
        python peekaboo_debug.py -c /path/to/your/peekaboo.conf
        ```
        
        **Note:** ``peekaboo_debug.py`` provides the same command line options like ``peekaboo``.
        They can be displayed by running
        
        ```shell
        python peekaboo_debug.py --help
        ```
