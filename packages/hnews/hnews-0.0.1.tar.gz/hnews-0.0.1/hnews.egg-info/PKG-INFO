Description: # Hackernews_CLI_v2
        A command line interface to browse content of Hacker News, built with Python. Unlike other CLIs for HackerNews, this one isn't a wrapper over it's Official API, rather the contents are scraped from the HTML page, thus is more efficient and fast. It lessens the server-client interaction thus saving bandwidth.
