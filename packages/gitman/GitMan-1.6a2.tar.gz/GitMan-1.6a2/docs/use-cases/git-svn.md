# Using Git SVN

Many development projects use Subversion (SVN) to manage their source code. It’s the most popular open source VCS and has been around for nearly a decade. It’s also very similar in many ways to CVS, which was the big boy of the source-control world before that.

One of Git’s great features is a bidirectional bridge to Subversion called `git svn`. This tool allows you to use Git as a valid client to a Subversion server, so you can use all the local features of Git and then push to a Subversion server as if you were using Subversion locally.

The gitman git svn support allows you to resolve SVN source dependencies. The gitman does resolve a specified SVN revision (e.g. HEAD) of an SVN repository source dependency (from whole branches to particular subdirectories).

To import svn repositories it is required to specify the repo source parameter `type` to `git-svn` for the corresponding entries.

Example Configuration:

```yaml
location: imports

sources:
- name: MyDirectory
  type: git-svn
  repo: http:http://my-svn-repo/trunk/MyDirectory
  rev: HEAD

- name: MySecondDirectory
  type: git-svn
  repo: http:http://my-svn-repo/trunk/MySecondDirectory
  rev: 72846

- name: lz4
  type: git
  repo: https://github.com/lz4/lz4
  rev: v1.8.1.2

```

By default the repo source parameter `type` is `git`.

> **Note** 
>
> The gitman `git svn` support uses internally 
> ```shell
> $ git svn clone -r <rev> <repo>
> ```
> to resolve the individual SVN source dependency. In this matter only the specified svn revsion will be fetched (shallow history).
