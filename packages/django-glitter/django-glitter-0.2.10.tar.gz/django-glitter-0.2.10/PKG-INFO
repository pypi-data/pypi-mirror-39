        3. Commit your changes: ``git commit -am 'Add some feature'``

        Run Development Tests
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        To facilitate testing we use tox_, which you can install with:
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
          pip install tox
        
        Currently we test on Python versions 2.7, 3.4 & 3.5 and Django versions 1.8,
        and 1.9.
        
        To use the same test suite, make sure you have the above mentioned Python
        interpreters installed, some platforms, like Ubuntu, won't have all versions
        available in their default package repository and you may need to add 'custom'
        repositories like Felix Krull's deadsnakes_. Depending on your development
        platform you may need to add development tools and each of the python versions
        development headers.
        
        Assuming you have all the supported python versions installed and forked the
        repository to `django-glitter` running the tests is a matter of:
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
          cd django-glitter
          tox
