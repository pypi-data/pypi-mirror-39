Installation
============


Stable release
--------------

TO DO: we still do not have a stable release on pypi

To install gpib-ctypes, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install gpib_ctypes

This is the preferred method to install gpib-ctypes, as it will always install the most recent stable release. 

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

From sources
------------

The sources for gpib-ctypes can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can install directly from the repo using pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/tivek/gpib_ctypes


Alternatively, install from a local copy of the source. You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/tivek/gpib_ctypes

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl  -OL https://github.com/tivek/gpib_ctypes/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install


.. _Github repo: https://github.com/tivek/gpib_ctypes
.. _tarball: https://github.com/tivek/gpib_ctypes/tarball/master
