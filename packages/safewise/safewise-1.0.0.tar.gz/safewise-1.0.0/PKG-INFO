        =============
        
        
        Python library and commandline client for communicating with SafeWISE
        Hardware Wallet
        
        See <https://safewise.io> for more information
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Python-safewise requires Python 3.3 or higher, and libusb 1.0. The easiest
        way to install it is with `pip`. The rest of this guide assumes you have
        a working `pip`; if not, you can refer to [this
        guide](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/).
        
        
        In addition to the above, you need to install development headers for
        HIDAPI.
        
        On a Debian or Ubuntu based system, you can install these:
        
        ```sh
        sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip cython3 libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev
        ```
        
        When installing the safewise library, you need to specify that you want
        `hidapi`:
        
        ```sh
        pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
        pip3 install safewise[hidapi]
        ```
        
        ### Ethereum support
        
        Ethereum requires additional python packages. Instead of
        `pip3 install safewise`, specify `pip3 install safewise[ethereum]`.
        
        You can combine it with the above, to get both HIDAPI and Ethereum
        support:
        
        ```sh
        pip3 install safewise[ethereum,hidapi]
        ```
        
        ### FreeBSD
        
        On FreeBSD you can install the packages:
        
        ```sh
        pkg install security/py-safewise
        ```
        
        or build via ports:
        
        ```sh
        cd /usr/ports/security/py-safewise
        make install clean
        ```
        
        Command line client (safewisectl)
        ------------------------------
        
        The included `safewisectl` python script can perform various tasks such as
        changing setting in the SafeWISE, signing transactions, retrieving account
        info and addresses. See the [docs/](docs/) sub folder for detailed
        examples and options.
        
        
        Python Library
        --------------
        
        You can use this python library to interact with a SafeWISE and
        use its capabilities in your application. See examples here in the
        [tools/](tools/) sub folder.
        
        PIN Entering
        ------------
        
        When you are asked for PIN, you have to enter scrambled PIN. Follow the
        numbers shown on SafeWISE display and enter the their positions using the
        numeric keyboard mapping:
        
        <table>
        <tr><td>7<td>8<td>9
        <tr><td>4<td>5<td>6
        <tr><td>1<td>2<td>3
        </table>
        
        Example: your PIN is **1234** and SafeWISE is displaying the following:
        
        <table>
        <tr><td>2<td>8<td>3
        <tr><td>5<td>4<td>6
        <tr><td>7<td>9<td>1
        </table>
        
        You have to enter: **3795**
