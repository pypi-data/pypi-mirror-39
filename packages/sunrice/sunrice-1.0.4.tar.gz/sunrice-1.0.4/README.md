# Sunrice - Garden Light Controller

Sunrice is a quick and dirty Python app for controlling my garden lights. It schedules on/off sequence at sunset/dawn, whereas exact times are calculated on daily basis. MQTT messages are sent to the PLC controller as a on/off sequence. Sunrice also reacts to `sunrise/on` and `sunrise/off` MQTT messagess (with no payload) to start the sequence manually.
