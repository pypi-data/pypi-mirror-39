Description: What is WAeUP.Kofa ?
        ********************
        
        Kofa means 'entrance' or 'portal' in Hausa language.
        
        WAeUP.Kofa is a multifunctional, open source, web based student
        management system to provide transparent and comprehensive
        information about application and study progress. The system
        controls all kinds of application and student registration processes
        at large schools and universities in Nigeria. It is a generic system
        which can be deployed by, and is useful to most universities,
        colleges or schools worldwide.
        
        WAeUP.Kofa is the flagship of the West African eUniversity Project
        (WAeUP). See http://www.waeup.org to learn more about WAeUP.
        
        WAeUP.Kofa is really an allrounder. The best way to briefly describe
        its functionality, is to explain what the software can *not* do for
        you, rather than trying to describe all its features in just a few
        words. Kofa is primarily not an e-learning system, although, it has
        some basic content management features which can be used by
        lecturers to disseminate course material. Kofa is also not a
        scheduler which generates lesson plans or timetables for lecturers
        or students. Although students register their courses with Kofa and
        can see or print course lists for each academic session, so far,
        courses do not contain information, when or where they take place.
        However, due to the modular design of Kofa, a scheduler or room
        planner could be easily added.
        
        WAeUP.Kofa is divided into sections. Each section has its own folder
        in Kofa's `object database`. When starting Kofa in debug mode::
        
          $ ./bin/kofactl debug
        
        we can use simple Python expression to view the first two levels of
        the database structure::
        
          >>> list(root.keys())
          [u'app']
          >>> list(root['app'].keys())
          [u'accesscodes', u'applicants', u'configuration', u'datacenter',
           u'documents', u'faculties', u'hostels', u'mandates', u'reports',
           u'students', u'users']
        
        
        The section/folder structure can be figured as follows::
        
          root (Database Root)
          |
          +---> app (University)
                |
                +---> faculties (Academic Section)
                |
                +---> students (Students Section)
                |
                +---> applicants (Aplicants Section)
                |
                +---> documents (Documents Section)
                |
                +---> hostels (Accommodation Section)
                |
                +---> accesscodes (Access Codes Section)
                |
                +---> configuration (Configuration Section)
                |
                +---> users (Officers)
                |
                +---> datacenter (Data Center)
                |
                +---> mandates (Mandates)
                |
                +---> reports (Reports)
        
        The user handbook follows this organizational structure and adds
        further chapters where needed. Also installation instructions and
        basic information about customization can be found there.

        Changes
        *******
        
        1.6 (2018-04-05)
        ================
        
        * Add ticket level and session filter to `CourseTicketExporter`.
        
        * Add 'Student Record Creation' Report page.
        
        * Add `CreateStudents` permission and `StudentsCreator` role.
        
        * Do not allow uploading data with trailing whitespaces.
        
        * Do no longer hide the 'Create students' buttons but switch the portal to
          maintenance mode to ensure that nobody can enter the portal during
          record creation except for user 'admin'. This guarantees that record
          creation is only started once.
        
        * Replace `gpa_boundaries` utility attribute by `GPABoundaries` method
          which may return different values in custom packages depending on faculty,
          department or certificate code (requested by AAU Ekpoma).
        
        * Allow `ApplicantOnlinePaymentProcessor` to import records without
          `p_id` column in create mode.
        
        * Add `waeup.showStudents` permission to `ExportManager` role.
        
        * Fix `CertificateProcessor.checkHeaders`. The processor requires both
          faculty_code *and* department_code in create mode.
        
        * Add 'Update all tickets' button to StudyLevelEditFormPage.
        
        * Do not allow to create more than 10 students with a single request to
          avoid a timeout of Nginx/Apache.
        
        * Redirect to manage page after editing of certificate courses.
        
        * Add `course_category` attribute to course tickets. In the base package,
          this attribute is omitted from display and manage pages.
        
        * Add `course_category` attribute to certificate courses.
        
        * Simplify configuration of maximum or minimum total credits.
        
        * Add `outstanding` attribute to course tickets.
        
        * Exclude graduated students from `LevelReport`, `SessionResultsPresentation`
          and `RawScoreReport`.
        
        * Allow applicants in states `admitted`, `not admitted` or `created` to
          download the payment slip.
        
        * Catch traceback (`RequiredMissing`) if a required field is cleared
          by import.
        
        * Add role `FingerprintReaderDeviceRole` intended for fingerprint reader
          devices that access the portal via XMLRPC.

        * Add `entry_session` and `p_session` filter to Student Payment Statistics
          generator. Adjust reports: Change footer and filename formats.
        
        * Add officer name fields do `IDepartment` and `IFaculty`.
          Plugins must be updated!
        
        * Add serial number column to Session Results Presentations.
        
        * Add Raw Score Report to base package.

        * Catch Reportlab `LayoutError`.
        
        * Replace `course_registration_allowed` by `course_registration_forbidden`
          method.
        
        * Add export purge button.
        
        * Add report purge button.
        
        * Add property attribute `total_score` in order to make provision
          for additional scores (like contineous assessments) in custom
          packages.
        
        * Make provision against storing other objects than applicant payments
          in applicant containers.
        
        * Count mandates on configuration page and provide 'Purge' button.
        
        * Start `ApplicantExporter` and `ApplicantPaymentExporter` at the same
          time when calling `ExportJobContainerJobStart`.
        
        * Add `ApplicantPaymentExporter`.
        
        * Add file upload functionality to `EditScoresPage`.

          `DataForLecturerExporter`. Only editable course tickets are being
          exported.
        
        * Remove application fee fallback option. Application fees can only
          be set via applicants containers. Hide Payment Tickets section on

        * Add  `ApplicantOnlinePaymentProcessor`.
        
        * Improve `AddStudyLevelFormPage`.

          exporters at course level. Lecturers can only export data of
          current academic session.
        
        * Show certificate-specific p_level value on payment pages.
          Ensure that only allowed payment levels can be selected when
          adding a balance payment.

        * Add `DegreeSource` and `degree` field to `ICertificate`.
          Plugins must be updated!
        
        * Upgrade bootstrap.py script and update some dependencies. For
          already running instances a new init might be neccessary, i.e.
          you might have to create a new virtualenv and run bootstap.py
          and buildout from that new virtualenv to get rid of old
          package versions in the runtime environment.
        
        * Upgrade versions.cfg to contain bugfix releases of packages we
          depend on.

          contain information about reserved bed spaces.
        
        * Add methods and page to release expired bed allocations.
        
        * Use lastname instead of firstname for first-time password requests.

        * Enable purging of applicants containers.
        
        * Enable pre-filling of applicants containers with empty
          application records which are used during self-registration
          to avoid excessive growth of the Data.fs.
        
        * Do only allow one running export job.

        1.2 (2014-06-16)
        ================

          workflow is now applied but, in contrast to regular applications,
          special applicants can create and pay more than one payment ticket.
          Also application slips are hidden.
        
        * Add setMatricNumber and constructMatricNumber methods to StudentsUtils.
        
        * When sending mails, always set from-address to 'no-reply@waeup.org'.
          Real from-addresses are now set in Cc and Reply-To fields. This is
          to tackle problems with yahoo (does not allow yahoo.com mails to be
          sent from non-yahoo servers).
        
        * Multiple payments in special application containers enabled.
          Special payment applicants remain in state started after payment.
        
        * File input fields brought into shape with Bootstrap 3.
        
        * Transcript and access code pagetemplates adjusted.
        
        * Print QR codes on all student slips.
        
        * Allow adding current_level to base data section on all student slips
          (requested by Uniben).
        
        * Windows is no longer supported. Installation manual removed.
        
        * Added JS helper to scroll to sequencelists after adding/removing items.
        
        
        1.1 (2014-03-13)
        ================
        
        * Add display_fullname column to `CourseTicketExporter` (requested by Uniben).
        
        * Do also export student and course ticket data of students on probation.
        
        * 'Create student' option removed from 'Application Transition'
          select field.
        
        * API docs added.
        
        * Back-to links replaced by animated jQuery plugins.
        
        * Default frontpage text updated.
        
        * Use absolute urls on datacenter pages.
        
        * Provide customizable method for disabling student payments.
        
        * After login and logout, regular users (officers) are redirected
          to the portal's index page not to the portal's root. The
          root URL can now be rewritten be Nginx or Apache so that the user
          is being redirected to the university website
          when entering the root URL directly or clicking the acronym.
        
        * Show tooltip alert and warning window before updating plugins.
        
        * JSAction has been deprecated. KofaAction can be used instead. Additional
          parameters can be used in @action decorators to enable tooltips and/or
          warning windows. The old @jsaction decorator still triggers a default
          warning message.
        
        * jquery-ui.min.js is also used for tooltips.
        
        * Do not create TSC AC batch when updating plugins.
          All TSC batches are created.
        
        * Make table on applicantsrootpage responsive.
        
        * Change width of input, select and textarea fields.
        
        * Use only https in theme.html.
        
        * INSTALL.txt updated and integrated into Sphinx documentation.
        
        * Redundancies removed in docs.

          different from it.
        
        * Change flash message for successful applicants.
