        <strong>Technical Note:</strong> During application, many records
        are being initialized but not used. For various reasons, many
        applicants do create one or more application records with
        corresponding user accounts but fail to log in. These records
        remain in state 'initialized' and are never turned to state
        'started'. After a while, these records can be safely removed.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Attention:</strong> When purging an applicants container, also
        all unused pre-filled application records are being removed.
        If necessary, the container must be pre-filled with empty
        records again.
