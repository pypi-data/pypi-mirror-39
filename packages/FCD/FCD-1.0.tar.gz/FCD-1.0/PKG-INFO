Description: # Fréchet ChemNet Distance
        
        The new wave of successful generative models in machine learning has increased
        the interest in deep learning driven de novo drug design. However, assessing
        the performance of such generative models is notoriously difficult. Metrics that
        are typically used to assess the performance of such generative models are the
        percentage of chemically valid molecules or the similarity to real molecules in
        terms of particular descriptors, such as the partition coefficient (logP) or druglike-
        ness. However, method comparison is difficult because of the inconsistent use of
        evaluation metrics, the necessity for multiple metrics, and the fact that some of
        these measures can easily be tricked by simple rule-based systems. We propose a
        novel distance measure between two sets of molecules, called Fréchet ChemNet
        distance (FCD), that can be used as an evaluation metric for generative models. The
        FCD is similar to a recently established performance metric for comparing image
        generation methods, the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID). Whereas the FID uses
        one of the hidden layers of InceptionNet, the FCD utilizes the penultimate layer
        of a deep neural network called “ChemNet”, which was trained to predict drug
        activities. Thus, the FCD metric takes into account chemically and biologically
        relevant information about molecules, and also measures the diversity of the set
        via the distribution of generated molecules. The FCD’s advantage over previous
        metrics is that it can detect if generated molecules are a) diverse and have similar
        b) chemical and c) biological properties as real molecules. We further provide an
        easy-to-use implementation that only requires the SMILES representation of the
        generated molecules as input to calculate the FCD.
