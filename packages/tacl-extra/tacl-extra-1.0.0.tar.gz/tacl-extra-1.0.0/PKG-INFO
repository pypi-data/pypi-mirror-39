Description: tacl-extra
        ==========
        
        tacl-extra provides scripts and libraries that make use of the `TACL`_
        software.
        
        Scripts provided are:
        
        * **int-all**: Generates extended and reduced intersect results files
          for every pair of texts in a supplied corpus.
        * **jitc**: Generates an HTML report showing the amount of overlap
          between a set of works, ignoring those parts that overlap with
          works in a second set of works.
        * **lifetime**: Generates results data and a report showing the
          lifetime of n-grams that come into or fall out of use in a group of
          corpora.
        * **paternity**: Generates a series of results files giving the
          n-grams in common between one corpus and each work in a second
          corpus, that are not present in a third corpus.
        
        The actual work of the scripts is done in library code that can be
        imported and used by other code.
