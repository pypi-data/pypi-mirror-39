PYCCC
=====

A lightweight, high-level python library for running asynchronous
commands in docker containers and handling their input and output files.

|PyPI version| |Codeship Status for Autodesk/py-cloud-compute-cannon|

What does the "CCC" stand for?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nothing currently! It originally stood for `Cloud Compute
Cannon <https://github.com/Autodesk/cloud-compute-cannon>`__, which this
project originally contained bindings for.

Installation
------------

Normal installation: ``pyccc`` works with Python 2.7 and 3.5+. In normal
operation, it also requires a local version of
`docker <https://www.docker.com/get-docker>`__ running.

.. code:: shell

    pip install pyccc

Dev install:

.. code:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/autodesk/py-cloud-compute-cannon
    pip install -e py-cloud-compute-cannon

Examples
--------

Run an executable in a docker container:

.. code:: python

    >>> engine = pyccc.engines.Docker()
    >>> job = engine.launch(image='alpine',
                            command='echo hello world')
    >>> job.wait()
    >>> job.stdout
    'hello world\n'
    >>> job.exitcode
    0

Call a python function *inside* a docker container and return the
result:

.. code:: python

    >>> engine = pyccc.engines.Docker()
    >>> def add_one_to_it(x):
    ...    return x+1
    >>> job = engine.launch(command=pyccc.PythonCall(add_one_to_it, 5),
    ...                     image='python:3.6-alpine')
    >>> job.wait()
    >>> job.result
    6

Documentation
-------------

Currently, whatever documentation exists, exists only in docstrings.

For Job options, see ``pyccc.Job.__doc__``.
