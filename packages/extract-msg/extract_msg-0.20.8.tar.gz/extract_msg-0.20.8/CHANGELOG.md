**v0.20.7:**

* Separated classes into their own files to make things more manageable.
* Placed `__doc__` back inside of `__init__.py`.
* Rewrote the `Prop` class to be two different classes that extend from a base class.
* Made decent progress on completing the `parse_type` function of the `FixedLengthProp` class (formerly a function of the `Prop` class).
* Improved exception handling code throughout most of the module.
* Updated the `.gitignore`.
* Updated README.
* Added `# DEBUG` comments before debugging lines to make them easier to find in the future.
* Added function `create_prop` in `prop.py` which should be used for creating what used to be an instance of the `Prop` class.
* Added more constants to reflect some of the changes made.
* Fixed a major bug that was causing the header to generate after things like "to" and "cc" which would force those fields to not use the header.
* Fixed the debug variable.
* Fixed many small bugs in many of the classes.
* [#11](https://github.com/Syncurity/msg-extractor/issues/11) Various loose ends to enhance the workflow in the repo.
