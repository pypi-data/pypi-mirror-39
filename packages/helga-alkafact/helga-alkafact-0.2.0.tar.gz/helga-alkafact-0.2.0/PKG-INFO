Description: helga-alkafact
        ===========
        
        to help us remember alkapwn's incredible achievements, we needed a bot plugin::
        
          <bigjust> ,rem add alkapwn threw a football over that mountain
          <bigjust> ,rem alkapwn
          <helga> alkapwn threw a football over that mountain
        
        the only subcommand would be `add`, which would be followed by the
        statement to add.
        
        If we're not `add`ing, then any term provided will be used to search
        the db and return a random fact.
