        --------------
        This repo provides a library called
        `thoth-storages <https://pypi.org/project/thoth-storages>`_.
        The library exposes core queries and methods for JanusGraph database as well
        as adapters for manipulating with Ceph via its S3 compatible API.
        
        Installation and Usage
        ======================
        
        The library can be installed via pip or pipenv:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           pipenv install thoth-storages
        
        The library does not provide any CLI, it is rather a low level library
        supporting other parts of Thoth.
        
        You can run prepared testsuite via the following command:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            pipenv install --dev
