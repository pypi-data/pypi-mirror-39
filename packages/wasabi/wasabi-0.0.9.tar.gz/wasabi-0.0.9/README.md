# wasabi: A lightweight console printing and formatting toolkit

Over the years, I've written countless implementations of coloring and
formatting utilities to output messages in our libraries like
[spaCy](https://spacy.io), [Thinc](https://github.com/explosion/thinc) and
[Prodigy](https://prodi.gy). While there are many other great open-source
options, I've always ended up wanting something slightly different or slightly
custom.

This package is still a work in progress and aims to bundle those utilities in
a standardised way so they can be shared across our other projects. It's super
lightweight, has zero dependencies and works across Python 2 and 3.

## üí¨ FAQ

### Are you going to add more features?

Yes, there's still a bunch of helpers and features to port over ‚Äì for example,
[Thinc](https://github.com/explosion/thinc)'s custom traceback printer. I'd also
love to add a nice training results table utility, since this is something that
we use a lot.

However, the new features will be heavily biased by what we (think we) need. I
always appreciate pull requests to improve the existing functionality ‚Äì but I
want to keep this library as simple, lightweight and specific as possible.

### Can I use this for my projects?

Sure, if you like it, feel free to adopt it! Just keep in mind that the package
is very specific and not intended to be a full-featured and fully customisable
formatting library. If that's what you're looking for, you might want to try
other packages ‚Äì for example, [`colored`](https://pypi.org/project/colored/),
[`crayons`](https://github.com/kennethreitz/crayons),
[`colorful`](https://github.com/timofurrer/colorful),
[`tabulate`](https://bitbucket.org/astanin/python-tabulate),
[`console`](https://github.com/mixmastamyk/console) or
[`py-term`](https://github.com/gravmatt/py-term), to name a few.

### Why `wasabi`?

I was looking for a short and descriptive name, but everything was already taken.
So I ended up naming this package after one of my rats, Wasabi. üêÄ
