        # HydroEval - An open-source evaluator for stream flow time series in Python
        
        HydroEval is an open-source evaluator for stream flow time series in Python. It is licensed under GNU GPL-3.0 (see [licence file](https://github.com/ThibHlln/hydroeval/blob/master/LICENCE.md) provided). The purpose of this evaluator is to compare observed and simulated hydrographs using one or more objective functions. HydroEval is designed to calculate all objective functions in a vectorised way (using [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy), and therefore C code in the background) which makes for very efficient computation of the objective functions.
        
        ## How to Install
        
        HydroEval is available on PyPI, so you can simply use pip and the name of the package:
        
            python -m pip install hydroeval
        
        You can also use pip and a link to the GitHub repository directly:
        
        	python -m pip install git+https://github.com/ThibHlln/hydroeval.git
        
        Alternatively, you can download the source code (*i.e.* the GitHub repository) and, from the downloaded directory itself, run the command:
        
            python setup.py install
        
        ## How to Use
        
        A tutorial in the form of a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ThibHlln/hydroeval/blob/master/examples/api_usage_example.ipynb) is available to get started with the usage of HydroEval's API. The input files required for the tutorial are all provided in the `examples/` folder.
        
        ## Objective Functions Available
        
        The objective functions currently available in HydroEval to evaluate the fit between observed and simulated stream flow time series are as follows:
        * [Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency](https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(70)90255-6) (`nse`)
        * [Original Kling-Gupta Efficiency](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.08.003) (`kge`) and its three components (r, Î±, Î²)
        * [Modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.01.011) (`kgeprime`) and its three components (r, Î³, Î²)
        * Root Mean Square Error (`rmse`)
        * Mean Absolute Relative Error (`mare`)
        * Percent Bias (`pbias`)
        
        Moreover, KGE and NSE can be calculated in a bounded version following [Mathevet et al. (2008)](https://iahs.info/uploads/dms/13614.21--211-219-41-MATHEVET.pdf):
        
        * Bounded Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (`nse_c2m`)
        * Bounded Original Kling-Gupta Efficiency (`kge_c2m`)
        * Bounded Modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (`kgeprime_c2m`)
        
        Finally, any of the objective functions can take an optimal argument `transform`. This argument allows to apply a transformation on both the observed and the simulated stream flow time series prior the calculation of the objective function. The possible transformations are as follows:
        * Inverted flows (using `transform='inv'`)
        * Square Root-transformed flows (using `transform='sqrt'`)
        * Natural Logarithm-transformed flows (using `transform='log'`)
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        HydroEval requires the popular Python package `numpy` to be installed on the Python implementation where `hydroeval` is installed.
