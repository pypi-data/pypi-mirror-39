        How to use
        ==========
        
        The `BLOB support in Plone`__ is amazing for a lot of reasons.
        
        __ https://pypi.org/project/plone.app.blob
        
        However, right now, Plone will raise errors when you visit a file content that use BLOB support,
        without having also the BLOB file.
        
        I don't know if this is good or not (I opened `an issue`__ related to this), but for developers this
        can be a little boring. It's quite common to copy a production ``Data.fs`` for developing something
        using production data, but you don't always want to copy all blobs.
        
        __ http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11293
        
        This product monkey-patches some points inside Plone, so visiting objects that store content in blob-Fields (like ATFile/ATImage) without its BLOB available will not show any errors to visitors. Instead a file only containing the string "File created by experimental.gracefulblobmissing." is created in the place where the blob-file should be.
        
        
        Catalog
        -------
        
        This product also patches the ``SearchableText`` Archetypes method, so you can reindex
        you catalog without errors.
