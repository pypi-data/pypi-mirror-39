        """A fitting regular is the collection of data components (e.g. the regular, noise-maps, PSF, etc.) which are used \
        to fit a generate a model regular of the fitting regular and fit it to its observed regular.

        The fitting regular is masked, by converting all relevent data-components to masked 1D arrays (which are \
        syntacically followed by an underscore, e.g. noise_map_). 1D arrays are converted back to 2D masked arrays
        after the fit, using the mask's *scaled_array_from_1d_array* function.

        A fitting regular also includes a number of attributes which are used to performt the fit, including (y,x) \
        grids of coordinates, convolvers and other utilities.

        Parameters
        ----------
        image : im.Image
            The 2D observed regular and other observed quantities (noise-map, PSF, exposure-time map, etc.)
        mask: msk.Mask
            The 2D mask that is applied to regular data.
        sub_grid_size : int
            The size of the sub-grid used for computing the SubGrid (see imaging.mask.SubGrid).
        image_psf_shape : (int, int)
            The shape of the PSF used for convolving model regular generated using analytic light profiles. A smaller \
            shape will trim the PSF relative to the input regular PSF, giving a faster analysis run-time.

        Attributes
        ----------
        image : ScaledSquarePixelArray
            The 2D observed regular data (not an instance of im.Image, so does not include the other data attributes,

        grids : imaging.mask.DataGrids
            Grids of (y,x) Cartesian coordinates which map over the masked 1D observed regular's pixels (includes an \
            regular-grid, sub-grid, etc.)
        padded_grids : imaging.mask.DataGrids
            Grids of padded (y,x) Cartesian coordinates which map over the every observed regular's pixel in 1D and a \
            padded regioon to include edge's for accurate PSF convolution (includes an regular-grid, sub-grid, etc.)
        border  imaging.mask.ImagingGridsBorders
            The border of the regular-grid and sub-grid (see *ImagingGridsBorders* for their use).
