        """
        Abstract base class representing the mapping between the pixels in an observed regular of a strong lens and \
        the pixels of a pixelization.

        1D arrays are used to represent these mappings, in particular between the different regular-grids (e.g. the \
        regular and sub grids, see the *imaging.masks module*). The nomenclature here follows grid_to_grid, whereby the \
        index of a value on one grid equals another. For howtolens:

        - image_to_pixelization[2] = 1 tells us that the 3rd regular-pixel maps to the 2nd pixelization-pixel.
        - sub_to_pixelization[4] = 2 tells us that the 5th sub-pixel maps to the 3rd pixelization-pixel.
        - pixelization_to_image[2] = 5 tells us that the 3rd pixelization-pixel maps to the 6th (masked) regular-pixel.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pixels : int
            The number of pixels in the pixelization.
        grids: masks.DataGrids
            A collection of grid describing the observed regular's pixel coordinates (includes an regular and sub grid).

    def mapping_matrix(self):
        """The mapping matrix is a matrix representing the mapping between every observed regular-pixel and \
        pixelization pixel. Non-zero entries signify a mapping, whereas zeros signify no mapping.

        For howtolens, if the observed regular has 5 pixels and the pixelization 3 pixels, with the following mappings:

        regular pixel 0 -> pixelization pixel 0
        regular pixel 1 -> pixelization pixel 0
        regular pixel 2 -> pixelization pixel 1
        regular pixel 3 -> pixelization pixel 1
        regular pixel 4 -> pixelization pixel 2

        The mapping matrix (which is of dimensions image_pixels x source_pixels) would appear as follows:

        [1, 0, 0] [0->0]
        [1, 0, 0] [1->0]
        [0, 1, 0] [2->1]
        [0, 1, 0] [3->1]
        [0, 0, 1] [4->2]

        The mapping matrix is in fact built using the sub-grid of the observed regular, where each regular-pixel is \
        divided into a regular grid of sub-pixels each of which are paired to pixels in the pixelization. The entires \
        in the mapping matrix now become fractional values dependent on the sub-grid size. For howtolens, for a 2x2 \
        sub-grid in each pixel (which means the fraction value is 1.0/(2.0^2) = 0.25, if we have the following mappings:

        regular pixel 0 -> sub pixel 0 -> pixelization pixel 0
        regular pixel 0 -> sub pixel 1 -> pixelization pixel 1
        regular pixel 0 -> sub pixel 2 -> pixelization pixel 1
        regular pixel 0 -> sub pixel 3 -> pixelization pixel 1
        regular pixel 1 -> sub pixel 0 -> pixelization pixel 1
        regular pixel 1 -> sub pixel 1 -> pixelization pixel 1
        regular pixel 1 -> sub pixel 2 -> pixelization pixel 1
        regular pixel 1 -> sub pixel 3 -> pixelization pixel 1
        regular pixel 2 -> sub pixel 0 -> pixelization pixel 2
        regular pixel 2 -> sub pixel 1 -> pixelization pixel 2
        regular pixel 2 -> sub pixel 2 -> pixelization pixel 3
        regular pixel 2 -> sub pixel 3 -> pixelization pixel 3

        The mapping matrix (which is still of dimensions image_pixels x source_pixels) would appear as follows:
