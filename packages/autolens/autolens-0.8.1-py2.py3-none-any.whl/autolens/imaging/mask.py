class SubGrid(ImageGrid):
    """Abstract class for a sub-grid of coordinates. On a sub-grid, each padded pixel is sub-gridded into a uniform \
     grid of (y,x) sub-coordinates..

    Coordinates are defined from the top-left corner, such that pixels in the top-left corner of an \
    masks (e.g. [0,0]) have negative x and y-values in arc seconds. The masks pixel indexes are also counted from the \
    top-left.

    Sub-pixels follow the same convention as above, where the top-left sub-pixel has the lowest x and y-values in each \
    datas_-pixel. Sub-pixel indexes include all previous sub-pixels in all previous padded datas_-pixels.

    A *SubGrid* is a NumPy array of shape [image_pixels*sub_grid_pixels**2, 2]. The first element of the ndarray \
    corresponds to the padded sub-pixel index, and second element the sub-pixel's (y,x) arc second coordinates. \
    For howtolens:

    - sub_grid[9, 1] - using a 2x2 sub-grid, gives the 3rd datas_-pixel's 2nd sub-pixel y-coordinate.
    - sub_grid[9, 1] - using a 3x3 sub-grid, gives the 2nd datas_-pixel's 1st sub-pixel y-coordinate.
    - sub_grid[27, 0] - using a 3x3 sub-grid, gives the 4th datas_-pixel's 1st sub-pixel x-coordinate.

    Below is a visual illustration of a sub grid. Like the regular grid, the indexing of each sub-pixel goes from \
    the top-left corner. In contrast to the regular grid above, our illustration below restricts the masks to just
    2 pixels, to keep the illustration brief.

    |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|
    |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|     This is an howtolens masks.Mask, where:
    |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|
    |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|     x = True (Pixel is masked and excluded from lensing)
    |x|x|x|x|o|o|x|x|x|x|     o = False (Pixel is not masked and included in lensing)
    |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|
    |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|
    |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|
    |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|
    |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|

    Our regular-grid looks like it did before:

    pixel_scale = 1.0"

    <--- -ve  x  +ve -->

    |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|  ^
    |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|  |
    |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|  |
    |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x| +ve  regular_grid[0] = [-1.5,  0.5]
    |x|x|x|0|1|x|x|x|x|x|  y   regular_grid[1] = [-0.5,  0.5]
    |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x| -ve
    |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|  |
    |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|  |
    |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x| \/
    |x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|

    However, we now go to each masks-pixel and derive a sub-pixel grid for it. For howtolens, for pixel 0,
    if *sub_grid_size=2*, we use a 2x2 sub-grid:

    Pixel 0 - (2x2):

           regular_grid[0] = [-1.66, 0.66]
    |0|1|  regular_grid[1] = [-1.33, 0.66]
    |2|3|  regular_grid[2] = [-1.66, 0.33]
           regular_grid[3] = [-1.33, 0.33]

    Now, we'd normally sub-grid all pixels using the same *sub_grid_size*, but for this illustration lets
    pretend we used a sub_grid_size of 3x3 for pixel 1:

             regular_grid[0] = [-0.75, 0.75]
             regular_grid[1] = [-0.5,  0.75]
             regular_grid[2] = [-0.25, 0.75]
    |0|1|2|  regular_grid[3] = [-0.75,  0.5]
    |3|4|5|  regular_grid[4] = [-0.5,   0.5]
    |6|7|8|  regular_grid[5] = [-0.25,  0.5]
             regular_grid[6] = [-0.75, 0.25]
             regular_grid[7] = [-0.5,  0.25]
             regular_grid[8] = [-0.25, 0.25]
