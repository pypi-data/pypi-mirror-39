toolkit
-------

This is my NGS analysis toolkit: ``ngs_toolkit``.

It contains most code Iâ€™ve been using in the last 2-3 years in various
projects and hopefully is of interest.

Head to the `documentation <http://ngs-toolkit.readthedocs.io/>`__ to
see how to install and use the toolkit, and have a look at the catalogue
of available functions.

Install with:

.. code:: bash

   pip install ngs-toolkit

You might need to add a ``--user`` flag to the above command.
