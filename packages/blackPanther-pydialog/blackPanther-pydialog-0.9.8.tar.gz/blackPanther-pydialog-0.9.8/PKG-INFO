Description: 
            My problem was that the kdialog code is still not ported previously to Qt5 
            and it depends on various Qt4/KDE4 components. 
            The kdialog has big dependency sizes so we made an alternate dialogs like 
            kdialog switches, options (Zenity is too ugly and Gtk based). 
            We would still like full compatibility with kdialog but a few options are 
            still not finished and although this release provides many important 
            functions.
        
            Patches, extensions, ideas are welcome!
