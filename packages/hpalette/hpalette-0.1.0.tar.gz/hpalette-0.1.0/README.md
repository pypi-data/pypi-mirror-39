# hpalette
Library of color palettes for Harvard identity guidelines.

## Motivation

The Harvard color palette happens to look nice, so I've packaged some associated color codes for the convenience of those who want to use them (currently, just in Python).

For example, consider [the color palette for the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/communications/identity-guidelines/color-palettes).

## Concerns

I'm not sure if these palettes happen to meet accessibility requirements and distinguishability when printed in black and white.
