PySINDy
========
PySINDy is a a Python project on Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics.
It contains software implementations of SINDy-related algorithms which are used 
 for system identification and mainly developed by Steve Brunton & Nathan Kutz. 
 But more importantly, it contains infrastructure for testing, documentation,
continuous integration and deployment, which can be easily adapted
to use in other projects.
To get started using these components in your own software, please go to the
repository README_.
