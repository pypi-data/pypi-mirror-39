        Creates local and remote git repository from command line. This tool is intended for **Python 3**.
        
        ## Install
        
        `pip install git-create-repo`
        
        Or
        
        `python setup.py install`
        
        Also make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed. 
        
        ## Usage
        
        `git_create.py [-h] [-p] [-s] [-n NAME]`
        
        #### Arguments
        
        ```
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        -p, --private         private repository
        -s, --ssh             switching from https to ssh remote url. Using
                              git@github.com... instead of https://github.com...
        -n NAME, --name NAME  name of remote repository
          ```
        
        Make sure you `cd` into the correct folder you want to create a repository in.
        
        #### Create public repository
        
        `git_create`
        
        #### Create private repository
        
        `git_create -p`
        
        #### Adding Remote repository name
        
        You can specify a different name for the remote repository with `-n`. Otherwise the local repo name will be used. 
        
        #### Switching Remote URL
        
        By default, remotes are added by HTTPS. You can change this to SSH by adding `-s`, assuming you have your SSH keys setup. 
        
        #### Github Username
        
        The tool simply fetches the username from `git config user.name`. If you don't have this set, the tool with prompt you to enter it beforehand. 
        
        #### Next steps
        
        * You will be prompted to enter your password and a description. The description can be skipped by simply pressing `enter`. If your password is incorrect, you will be prompted again.
        
        * If the above is successful, you will now have a repository created on your Github account. 
        
        ## Note
        
        * This will create a default `README.md` file including the name of your repository if none exist. 
        * It is also suggested to create your own `.gitignore`, so you can ignore what files you don't want commited beforehand. All files get committed otherwise. 
        
        ## Development
        
        ### Windows
        
        #### Installing Development Dependencies:
        
        * Run `build install`
        
        #### Testing Script
        
        * Use `test` folder generated from `build test` to run script. This is to ensure your actual git repository is not compromised. 
        
        The other build targets are used to upload to Pypi. 
        
        ### Linux
        
        #### Installing Development Dependencies
        
        * Ensure you have [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed. You can install this with `sudo apt-get install make`. 
        
        * To install development dependences, run `make install`.
        
        #### Testing Script
        
        * Use `test` folder generated from `make test` to run script. This is to ensure your actual git repository is not compromised. 
        
        The other build targets are used to upload to Pypi. 
        
        ## Future
        * Other features that can make this tool more usable. 
        * Please let me know in the issues tab.
