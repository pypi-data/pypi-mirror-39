Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The IETF_ uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it
        publishes as RFCs_, and for the draft documents which are produced when
        developing documents for publications.  There exists a number of different
        tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the
        existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them.  It takes as input
        an xml file which contains the text and meta-information about author names
        etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output.  The input xml file
        should follow the DTD given in RFC2629_ (or it's `inofficial successor`_).
        
        The current incarnation of **xml2rfc** provides output in the following
        formats: Paginated and unpaginated ascii text, html, nroff, and expanded xml.
        Only the paginated text format is currently (January 2013) accepable as draft
        submissions to the IETF.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        Version 2.15.3 (05 Dec 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This release fixes some issues found when running the html renderer over
          a corpus of all drafts submitted with xml format over the last 30 days,
          and an installation issue.
        
          * Handled utf-8 reloading in setup.py under py27 without using six, which 
            might be unavailable before the installation completes.
        
          * Always convert python lists to comma-separated strings before calling 
            on i18n address validation.
        
          * Added some guards to prevent operations on None.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.15.2 (02 Dec 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added a v3 version of the expansion renderer, to handle xi:include 
            processing and prettify the output for v3 xml files.
        
          * Fixed an issue with blank lines around the text rendering of artwork.
        
          * Introduced new pretty-print code which provide better indentation
            consistency between beginning and end tags.
        
          * Added a html() method to the html writer, for library model use, and did
            some minor refactoring.
        
          * Added a missing file.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.15.1 (01 Dec 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
        
          * Added downcoding of punctuation followed by wrapping of other non-ascii 
            text in <u> for the v2v3 converter.
        
          * Added BaseV3Writer methods: downcode() and downcode_punctuation(), 
            get_text_tags() and get_inline_tags() (works this out from the schema), and 
            added a list of deprecated elements.
        
          * Fixed a typo in an error message.  Added asciification of smart quotes 
            and other punctuation for the v3 renderers  to match that done for v2.  
            Some class refactoring.
        
          * Changed the workaround for non-ascii metadata in setup.py to only be 
            active under py2.  Fixes a problem with setup.py under python 3.x
        
          * Reverted [2786], which permitted non-ascii characters inside artwork
            for the v2 renderers, but broke when trying to write to file without
            utf-8 encoding.  Fixes issue #387.
