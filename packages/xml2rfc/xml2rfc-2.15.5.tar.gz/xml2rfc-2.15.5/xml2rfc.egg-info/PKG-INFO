Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The IETF_ uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it
        publishes as RFCs_, and for the draft documents which are produced when
        developing documents for publications.  There exists a number of different
        tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the
        existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them.  It takes as input
        an xml file which contains the text and meta-information about author names
        etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output.  The input xml file
        should follow the DTD given in RFC2629_ (or it's `inofficial successor`_).
        
        The current incarnation of **xml2rfc** provides output in the following
        formats: Paginated and unpaginated ascii text, html, nroff, and expanded xml.
        Only the paginated text format is currently (January 2013) accepable as draft
        submissions to the IETF.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        Version 2.15.5 (21 Dec 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added code to look for input marked as v3, and process that as v3 
            without requiring an explicit --v3 switch.  This should make it easier to 
            transition to v3 draft submissions.
        
          * Fixed a bug related to cref handling.  Fixes issue #389.
        
          * Ensured propagation of options to parser and url resolver, and improved 
            the error message for externals without .xml extension that give 404.
        
          * Fixed an include without explicit extension in a test input file, in 
            order to work with the stricter v3 formatter include processing.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.15.4 (18 Dec 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Tweaked the mkrelease script to prevent inclusion of temporary editor 
            files.
        
          * Fixed a problem with string vs byte for referece file output.
        
          * Added a limitation on the intervaltree requirements to avoid a broken
            version.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.15.3 (05 Dec 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This release fixes some issues found when running the html renderer over
          a corpus of all drafts submitted with xml format over the last 30 days,
          and an installation issue.
        
          * Handled utf-8 reloading in setup.py under py27 without using six, which 
            might be unavailable before the installation completes.
        
          * Always convert python lists to comma-separated strings before calling 
            on i18n address validation.
        
          * Added some guards to prevent operations on None.
