Installation
============

::

    pip3 install python-flashcards

What flashcards are
===================

  A flashcard or flash card is a set of cards bearing information, as words or numbers, on either or both sides, used in classroom drills or in private study. One writes a question on a card and an answer overleaf. `[Wikipedia] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard>`_

How does this work
==================

``python-flashcards`` is a small tool, which receives cards from a ``YAML`` file, and shows them in a random order so you can practice.

``YAML`` format:

.. code-block:: yaml

  -
    topic: The topic I will say out loud
    content: The information I'll check after saying out loud what I know
    keywords: reference, words
  -
    topic: Python
    content: Is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming,
      created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
    keywords: programming, language


Being ``keyword`` the only optional.

Usage
=====

Let's supouse ``anatomy.yaml`` is your file with information related to anatomy.

::

    flashcards anatomy.yaml


If you want the cards in order:

::

    flashcards --ordered meds.yaml

If you want to show the hide the topic instead of the content:

::

    flashcards --inverted meds.yaml

For more help:

::

    flashcards -h

Note, to combine the coverage data from all the tox environments run:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 10 90
    :stub-columns: 1

    - - Windows
      - ::

            set PYTEST_ADDOPTS=--cov-append
            tox

    - - Other
      - ::

            PYTEST_ADDOPTS=--cov-append tox
