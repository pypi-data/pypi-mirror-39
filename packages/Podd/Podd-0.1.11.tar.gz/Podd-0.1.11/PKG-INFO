Description: # Podd: a CLI podcatcher
        
        If you're anything like me, you listen to a lot of podcasts.  I like to archive all of my favorites on my home server, where I serve them to all my various devices via Plex.  I looked around for a podcatcher that would manage my podcasts and could be run as a cron job, but I didn't find anything that really met my needs.  So I decided to write my own.
        
        Podd uses [feedparser](https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/) to parse RSS feeds, a sqlite3 database to store subscription info, 
        and [mutagen](https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for rudimentary tagging functionality, plus it sends you an email letting you know which episodes were downloaded, along with a summary of each episode.  
        
        ## Installation
        Clone this repo, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
        
        Next, take a look at `config.py`.  I use a spare Gmail account to send the notification email messages, if you plan on doing the same, the `host` and `port` values are fine.  Using app-specific passwords like I'm doing here is a bit of a security risk, which is why I recommend not using your main Gmail account.  If you want to go this route,  you'll need to enable [app-specific passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).
        
        By default, `database` setting places the sqlite database in the same directory as `config.py`.  If you want to put it someplace else, just change that line to where you want it to be.
        
        ### Requirements
        * Python 3.6+ (F-strings are the bomb!)
        * Some *nix flavor.  It runs on the latest version of MacOS and Ubuntu with no problems, but I lack a working windows installation to test.  If you want to port it, go nuts.
        
        ## Usage
        
        In your terminal of choice, enter `python3 podd.py` followed by one of the following switches:
        * `-a URL` will attempt to add URL to the database.
        * `-A feeds.txt` will attempt to add podcast RSS URLs located in feeds.txt  Text files should be a single URL per line.
        * `-b /directory/to/store/podcast/downloads` Sets the download directory for newly added podcasts.  The default option is `$HOME/Podcasts`.  Note: changing this will have no effect on current subscriptions, only affecting newly added podcasts.
        * `-o` Prints out the currently set options.
        * `-r` Displays the deletion menu
        * `-c all` or `-c new`  Sets option for newly added podcasts to download only new episodes, or the entire available back catalog.  The default behavior is to only download the newest episode.  Note: this, too, will have no effect on podcasts to which you're currently subscribed.
        * `-d` Refresh all podcasts, download new episodes and send an email notification.
        * `-e` Runs the email notification setup function, storing sender email address and password and recipient address in database
        * `-n on` or `-n off` to toggle email notifications on or off
        
        ## Todo List
        * At the moment, nothing, I'm pretty happy with where the project is.
