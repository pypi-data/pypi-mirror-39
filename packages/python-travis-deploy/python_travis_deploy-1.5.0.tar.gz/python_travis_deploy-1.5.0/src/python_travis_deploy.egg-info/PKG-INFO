Description: Python Travis Deploy
        ====================
        
        A test project for deploying to PyPI from Travis
        
        Deployment Strategy
        -------------------
        
        - Any user can create a new branch and commits that puts the package
          into a deployable state. (Updating changelog, putting release date, etc)
          The branch must be named ``release-x.x.x`` to trigger integration tests
        - User creates a Pull Request to the repo as normal.
        - Travis runs unit tests as normal.
        - Travis runs integration tests due to the ``release-x.x.x`` branch name.
        - Once merged any maintainer can tag the squashed commit and push tags to GitHub.
        - Travis will build and deploy the tagged commit and upload to PyPI.
        - Travis will prepare a GitHub release draft for the tag.
        - Once you're satisfied with the release content (ie changelog entry info)
          you can publish the release.
        
        Configuration Options
        ---------------------
        
        - If your deployment uses universal wheels you can consolidate the
          two PyPI deployments into one and build both within ``_travis/deploy.sh``.
        - If you're not a fan of GitHub releases you can remove that section
          within ``deploy:`` in ``.travis.yml``.
