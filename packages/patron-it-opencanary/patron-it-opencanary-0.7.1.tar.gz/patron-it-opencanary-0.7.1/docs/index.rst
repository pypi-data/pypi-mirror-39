OpenCanary
===========

Welcome to the OpenCanary guide.

OpenCanary is a daemon that runs canary services, which trigger alerts
when (ab)used. The alerts can be sent to a variety of sources,
including syslog, emails and a companion daemon opencanary-correlator.

The Correlator coalesces multiple related events (eg. individual
brute-force login attempts) into a single alert sent via email or
SMS.
