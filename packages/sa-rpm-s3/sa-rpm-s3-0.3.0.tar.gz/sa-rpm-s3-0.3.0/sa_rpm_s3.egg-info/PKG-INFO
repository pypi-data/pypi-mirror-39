Version: 0.3.0
Summary: This small tool allows you to maintain YUM repositories of RPM packages on S3. The advantage of this tool is that it does not need a full copy of the repo to operate. Just give it the new package to add, and it will just update the repodata metadata, and upload the given rpm file.
