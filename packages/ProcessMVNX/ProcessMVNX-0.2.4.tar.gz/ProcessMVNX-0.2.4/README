Tool for reading and processing MVNX-Files from the xsens-Awinda Motion
Capturing System.

This is still highly incomplete! 
Build tarball with: `python setup.py sdist`,
and install via: `pip install dist/ProcessMVNX-0.x.tar.gz`

bin: empty directory for possible future scripts
data: symlink to data for testing purposes only
docs: will probably stay empty forever
ProcessMVNX: module directory
tests: some post-hoc tests :)
