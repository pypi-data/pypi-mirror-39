Description: ## Weight Watcher
        
        **Weight Watcher** analyzes weight matrices of Deep Neural Networks.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```sh
        pip install weightwatcher
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Weight Watcher works with both Keras and pyTorch models.
        
        ```python
        import weightwatcher as ww
        watcher = ww.WeightWatcher(model=model)
        results = watcher.analyze()
        
        watcher.get_summary()
        watcher.print_results()
        ```
