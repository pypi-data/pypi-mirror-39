        All task parameters except the name, callback, queue, force_run and propagate_skip
        can either be their native type or a callable returning the native type.

        Args:
            name (str): The name of the task.
            paths (str/list/callable): A path, or list of paths, to look in for files.
                                       The paths have to be absolute paths, otherwise an

                                       returns a string or a list of strings.
            callback (callable): A callable object that is called with the result of the
                                 glob operation. The function definition is
                                 def callback(files, data, store, signal, context).
            pattern (str): The glob style pattern to match when returning files.
            recursive (bool): Recursively look for files. Use ** to match any files
                              and zero or more directories and subdirectories.
                              May slow things down if lots of files.
            return_abs (bool): If True return absolute paths,
                               if False return filename only.
            queue (str): Name of the queue the task should be scheduled to. Defaults to
                         the general task queue.
            callback_init (callable): A callable that is called shortly before the task
                                      is run. The definition is:

                                      context the task context.
            callback_finally (callable): A callable that is always called at the end of
                                         a task, regardless whether it completed
                                         successfully, was stopped or was aborted.
