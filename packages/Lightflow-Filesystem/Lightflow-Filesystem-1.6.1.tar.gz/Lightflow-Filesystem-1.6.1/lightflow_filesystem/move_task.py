            name (str): The name of the task.
            sources (str/list/callable): A single file or directory path or a list of
                                         file or directory paths that should be moved.
                                         This parameter can either be a string, a list of

                                         paths, otherwise an exception is thrown.
            destination: The destination file or folder the source should be
                         moved to. This parameter can either be a string or a
                         callable returning a string.
            queue (str): Name of the queue the task should be scheduled to. Defaults to
                         the general task queue.
            callback_init (callable): A callable that is called shortly before the task

                                         a task, regardless whether it completed
                                         successfully, was stopped or was aborted.
