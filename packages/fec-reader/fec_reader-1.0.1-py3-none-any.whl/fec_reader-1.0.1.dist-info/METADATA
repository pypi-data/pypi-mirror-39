FEC Data Reader
==========================

A quick way to retrieve FEC bulk data from https://www.fec.gov:

``` {.sourceCode .python}
>>> import fec_reader as fec
>>> reader = fec.DataReader(DATA_DIR='/raw') # pick a target directory
>>> reader.get_pac_summary()
```

This package is a demonstration of ETL skills for Alexus Wong. However, it is also important
that we as a society can efficiently consume the inordinate amount of information available
today. If we can process it, we can take steps in the right direction.
