Description: FEC Data Reader
        ==========================
        
        A quick way to retrieve FEC bulk data from https://www.fec.gov:
        
        ``` {.sourceCode .python}
        >>> import fec_reader as fec
        >>> reader = fec.DataReader(DATA_DIR='/raw') # pick a target directory
        >>> reader.get_pac_summary()
        ```
        
        This package is a demonstration of ETL skills for Alexus Wong. However, it is also important
        that we as a society can efficiently consume the inordinate amount of information available
        today. If we can process it, we can take steps in the right direction.
        
        There is a 5 second delay between files to respect FEC.gov's bandwith.
