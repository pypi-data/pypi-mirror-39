Description: # Tetrationcli to interact with Tetration Cluster via the cli
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### From PyPI
        
        ```
        pip install tetrationcli
        ```
        
        ### From sources
        
        Download the sources from [Github](https://github.com/jumolinas/tetrationcli), extract and execute the following commands
        
        ```
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        $ pip install setup.py
        ```
        
        ## How to use this application:
        To access to the cluster you need to get the API Credentials. Download the api_credentials.json locally 
        to get the information required for the setup.
        
        ```
        $ tetrationcli -h
        usage: tetrationcli [-h] [-d] [-q] [-v]
                            {inventory,vrfs,applications,users,roles,scopes,switches,agents,clear,setup}
                            ...
        
        Tetration Analytics CLI tool
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -d, --debug           full application debug mode
          -q, --quiet           suppress all console output
          -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
        
        sub-commands:
          {inventory,vrfs,applications,users,roles,scopes,switches,agents,clear,setup}
            inventory           Interact with Inventory from Tetration Cluster
            vrfs                Interact with VRFs in Tetration Cluster
            applications        Interact with ADM Application from Tetration Cluster
            users               Interact with Users from Tetration Cluster
            roles               Interact with Roles in Tetration Cluster
            scopes              Interact with Scopes configured in Tetration Cluster
            switches            Interact with Hardware Sensors from Tetration Cluster
            agents              Interact with Software Sensors in Tetration Cluster
            clear               Clear the configuration
            setup               Application setup
        
        Usage: tetrationcli command
        ```
        ### Easy setup
        
        Step 1: Issue `tetrationcli setup` and folow the instructions and place the correct information presented
        ```
        $ tetrationcli setup
        Tetration Analytics cluster (eg: https://great.example.com/): https://great.example.com/
        Tetration API Key: ASDASDASADS
        Tetration API Secret: ASDASDASDASDFFF
        ```
        
        Step 2: Test if you can successfully query the cluster from the command line
        ```
        $ tetrationcli agents list
        ```
        
        ### Alternative way to setup the application
        
        The file `api_credentials.json` downloaded from the cluster is expected to be placed in 
        folder `~/.config/tetrationcli/` then to define the cluster name you need to create the 
        config file `tetrationcli.conf` in `~/.config/tetrationcli/`
        
        ```
        total 16
        0 drwxr-xr-x   4 user  staff  128 Nov 11 16:16 .
        0 drwx------  13 user  staff  416 Nov 11 16:10 ..
        8 -rw-r--r--@  1 user  staff  111 Nov 11 09:52 api_credentials.json
        8 -rw-r--r--   1 user  staff  121 Nov 11 16:16 tetrationcli.conf
        ```
        and the file `tetrationcli.conf` requires the information:
        ```
        [tetrationcli]
        api_endpoint = https://mygreatapp.example.com
        api_credentials = ~/.config/tetrationcli/api_credentials.json
        ```
