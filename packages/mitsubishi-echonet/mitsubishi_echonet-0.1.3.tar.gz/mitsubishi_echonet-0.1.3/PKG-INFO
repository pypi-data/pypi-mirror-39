Description: # mitsubishi_echonet
        
        A library for interfacing with Mitsubishi HVAC with the Echonet lite protocol
        over WiFi adaptors such as the MAC-568IF-E.
        
        It is specifically designed for use with Home Assistant, and its functionality
        is limited to HVAC systems, but it could be potentially extended for other
        Echonet lite applications and become a more general purpose library.
        
        Similar implementations seem to be Node JS middleware running on Docker
        containers to interface into the MQTT API however this is designed to be used
        as a straight up library, no middleware, Node JS or Docker containers needed!
        
        It is designed to work with Python 3.7 out of the box as
        that was the environment I was working on.
        
        # Instructions
        
        Simplest way to install is to use pip:
        pip install mitsubishi_echonet
        
        # Using the library
        
        There are two files under /bin
        'example.py' is an executable Python3 script that will discover your
        Mitsubishi HVAC and play with some settings.
        
        'mitsubishi.py' is for use with Home Assistant.
        Copy it into your 'custom_components'
        
        In configuration.yaml add the following lines:
        
        climate:
          - platform: mitsubishi
            ip_address: 1.2.3.4
        
        # Help! Home Assistant could not run the module?
        
        When I was playing around with this I had difficulty getting hass.io to install
        the library from pip. No idea why, but eventually I found the correct
        combination to get it to work as it is supposed to.
        
        However, there is a workaround:
        
        1. Clone the repo
        2. Copy the 'mitsubishi_echonet' subfolder directly out of the repo and
        into the 'custom_components' directory.
        3. Flip the comments on the following lines in mitsubishi.py:
        
        from mitsubishi_echonet import lib_mitsubishi as mit
        &#35; from custom_components.mitsubishi_echonet import lib_mitsubishi as mit
        
        Make sure you enable the ECHONET Lite service in the official Mitsubishi App.
        
        Comments and suggestions are welcome!
        
        # Thanks
        
        Thanks to Jeffro Carr who inspired me to write my own native Python ECHONET
        library for Home Assistant. I could not get his Node JS Docker container
        to work properly on Hass.io :-)
        Some ideas in his own repo got implemented in my own code.

        Also big thanks to Futomi Hatano for open sourcing a high quality and
        extremely well documented ECHONET Lite library in Node JS that  
        formed the basis of my reverse engineering efforts.
