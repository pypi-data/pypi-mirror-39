"""Bocadillo middleware definition.

A middleware is a class that implements the ASGI protocol.

There are two kinds of middleware classes:
- Routing middleware: suited for performing operations before and after
routing occurs.
- Common middleware: suited for all other middleware operations.

Common middleware should be called first, then routing middleware, which should
end up calling the actual Bocadillo API object.
