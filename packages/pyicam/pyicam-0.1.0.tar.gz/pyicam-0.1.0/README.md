## Overview

PyICAM is a simple, SAML authentication library to help Python software developers use the [NOAA Identity, Credential, Access and Federation Management (ICAM)](https://noaaonline.noaa.gov/contact_us.html) login provider in a consistent fashion.

It consists of a minimal, easy to use interface around the open-source [python3-saml](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python3-saml) toolkit from Onelogin, Inc.

Online documentation is at https://github.com/nwfsc-data/PyICAM

## Quick Start
Add SSO authentication to your existing Python webserver, with these steps:

- [Certificate & Secret key](#certificate-secret-key)
- [Define your application attributes](#define-your-application-attributes)
- [Obtain SSO Authority attributes](#obtain-sso-authority-attributes)
- [Create settings file](#create-settings-file)
- [Submit Metadata](#submit-metadata)
- [Add your metadata URL](#add-your-metadata-url)
- [Add your login URL](#add-your-login-url)
- [Add your logout URL](#add-your-logout-url) - TBD

### Certificate & Secret key
1). Your Python application will identify itself to others with a public certificate, and private key used for signing.

Obtain a keypair that is acceptable by the SSO team (your organization may already have a keypair which would be suitable to identify your webserver).

If none is available, the following command may be used to generate a new secret key & certificate request for signature:

```
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout secrets/server.key -out CERT_REQUEST.csr
```

* Complete certificate details, as required by the Certificate Authority from whom you obtain a signed HTTPS certificate (contact your PKI team for more info on your CA's requirements).
* Send your Certificate Authority the contents of: `CERT_REQUEST.csr`
* keep your `secrets/server.key` file secure. If anyone, at any time, can read this file - they can copy the key and impersonate your Python webserver.


### Define your application attributes
2). Make up some values, which will later be entered into a JSON settings file. These can be any values you want for your application, but should follow below format recommendations to minimize later problems.

Define a unique name, id, description & three URLs for your webserver. The URLs will be used to identify your webserver, and accept SSO and Single-Log-Out (SLO) transmissions from the remote SSO authority:

* serviceName: ___________________________
   - (Make a simple name for your application: "Amazing FRAM Service dev")
* serviceId: _______________________ (short, no spaces. E.g.: "AmazingFRAMServiceDev")
* serviceDescription: _______________________________________
   - (A short description. E.g.: "Amazing FRAM service development instance")
* custom URLs:
    - entityIdURL: ____________________________________ 
        - (E.g.: `https://my.sample_domain/great_service/saml/metadata/`)
        - (This will be used by ICAM SSO team and others to learn about your service, "saml/metadata/" is a very conventional URI ending for this)
    - assertionConsumerServiceURL: _______________________________________ (E.g.: `https://my.sample_domain/great_service/saml/?acs`)
    - singleLogoutServiceURL: ___________________________________ (E.g.: `https://my.sample_domain/great_service/saml/?sls`)

### Obtain SSO Authority attributes
3). Contact the operator of your SSO solution, and obtain their Identity Provider metadata. Generally this will be provided via an XML document named `noaa-online-idp-metadata.xml` or similar.

Gather details for the id, url & identifying certificate from the XML. This info will be used in Step 4:

* id: ______________ (XML encodes this as "entityID" property of the "EntityDescriptor" element. It's typically short, no spaces. Often also at the end of the authority URLs)
* certificateText: ________________________________________ (will be long, base64 encoded text within a "ds:X509Certificate" element)
* remote SSO authority URLs:
    - singleSignOnServiceURL: ____________________________________
        - (Use the sign-on Location value which has Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST")
    - singleLogoutServiceURL: ____________________________________
        - (Use logout Location value which has Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect")

### Create settings file
4). Create a file called `settings.json` and populate it with the details from Step 2. & 3.:

```
{
    "strict": true,

    "debug": true,

    "sp": {
        "entityId": "__Enter_step2_entityIdURL__",
        "assertionConsumerService": {
            "url": "__Enter_step2_assertionConsumerServiceURL__",
            "binding": "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST"
        },
        "singleLogoutService": {
            "url": "__Enter_step2_singleLogoutServiceURL__",
            "binding": "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect"
        },
        "attributeConsumingService": {
                "serviceName": "__Enter_step2_name__",
                "serviceDescription": "__Enter_step2_description__",
                "requestedAttributes": [
                    {
                        "name": "__Enter_step2_id__",
                        "isRequired": false,
                        "nameFormat": "",
                        "friendlyName": "",
                        "attributeValue": []
                    }
                ]
        },
        "NameIDFormat": "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified",
        "x509cert": "",
        "privateKey": ""
    },

    "security": {
        "wantAssertionsSigned": true
    },

    "idp": {
        "entityId": "__Enter_step3_id__",
        "singleSignOnService": {
            "url": "__Enter_step3_singleSignOnServiceURL__",
            "binding": "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect"
        },
        "singleLogoutService": {
            "url": "__Enter_step3_singleLogoutServiceURL__",
            "binding": "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect"
        },
        "x509cert": "__Enter_step3_certificateText__"

    }
}
```

### Submit metadata
5). Generate metadata for your webserver, using the following code & submit the resulting `metadata` text to your SSO authority.

```python
from pyicam.saml.metadata import get_entity_descriptor
settings = 'settings.json' #specify the path to your files
cert = 'cert.pem' #save cert issued by your Certificate Authority in Step 1). in PEM format
key = 'secrets/server.key'
metadata, content_type = get_entity_descriptor(settings, cert, key)
print(metadata)
```

 * Your SSO Identity Provider operator will let you know if submitted metadata is acceptable, or if any settings changes must be made.
 * SSO operator will provide you with a login URL for "IdP-Initiated SSO". Directing your users to this link allows them to log into your application via the SSO Identity server: _________________________

### Add your metadata URL
6). Add the custom entityIdURL from [Step: Define your application attributes](#define-your-application-attributes) to your webserver, so it returns metadata as shown in the previous [Step: Submit metadata](#submit-metadata).

 * Note: the HTTP response returned by the URL must have the content type (`text/xml`) indicated by PyICAM.

### Add your login URL
7). Add the custom assertionConsumerServiceURL from [Step: Define your application attributes](#define-your-application-attributes) to your webserver, to recieve login notifications via HTTP POST:

```python
# step1) retrieve user details
from pyicam.saml.sso import login
host = "myserv.example.gov" # details for your webserver
port = "443"
path = "/myapp/saml" # url path for your assertionConsumerServiceURL
settings = 'settings.json' #specify the path to your files
cert = 'cert.pem'
key = 'secrets/server.key'
user = login(host, port, path, settings, cert, key, post_data=request.params) # also set parameter https=True if your webserver uses https on a port other than 443 
# step2) log in the user, using the provided dict, to create a user session in whatever fashion your program uses
# step3) your URL may now respond to the user, or redirect them, however you see fit
if 'relay_state' in user:
    # If the SSO login URL specified a SAML2 "RelayState" parameter for
    # the final redirect destination, PyICAM will return that value as: 'relay_state'
    users_saml2_RelayState_redirect_value = user['relay_state']
```

Congratulations! Users may now log into your application via the SSO link provided by your Identity authority in [Step: Submit metadata](#submit-metadata).

### Add your logout URL
8). (Adding custom singleLogoutServiceURL - TBD)
