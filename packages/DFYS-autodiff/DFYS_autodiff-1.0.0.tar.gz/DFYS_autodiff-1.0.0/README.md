### Quick Installation Guide

#### Install Through PyPI

The easiest way to install `autodiff` is by `pip`. In the command line, type in:

#### Install Manually

The user can choose to install `autodiff` directly from the source in this repository. We suppose that the user has already installed `pip` and `virtualenv`:

1. clone the project repo by `git clone git@github.com:D-F-Y-S/cs207-FinalProject.git`
2. `cd` into the local repo and create a virtual environment by `virtualenv env` 
3. activate the virtual environment by `source env/bin/activate` (use `deactivate` to deactivate the virtual environment later.)
4. install the dependencies by `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. install `autodiff` by `pip install -e .`
