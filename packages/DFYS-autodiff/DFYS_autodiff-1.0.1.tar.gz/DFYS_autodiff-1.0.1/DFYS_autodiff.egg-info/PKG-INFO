        ### Quick Installation Guide
        
        #### Install Through PyPI
        
        The easiest way to install `autodiff` is by `pip`. In the command line, type in:
        
        ```
        pip install DFYS-autodiff
        ```
        
        
        
        #### Install Manually
        
        The user can choose to install `autodiff` directly from the source in this repository. We suppose that the user has already installed `pip` and `virtualenv`:
        
        1. clone the project repo by `git clone git@github.com:D-F-Y-S/cs207-FinalProject.git`
        2. `cd` into the local repo and create a virtual environment by `virtualenv env` 
        3. activate the virtual environment by `source env/bin/activate` (use `deactivate` to deactivate the virtual environment later.)
        4. install the dependencies by `pip install -r requirements.txt`
        5. install `autodiff` by `pip install -e .`
