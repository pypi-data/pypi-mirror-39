Compatibility
=============

.. admonition:: Summary
	:class: tip

	- We optimize Shady's performance on Windows. It works on other operating
	  systems, but there your mileage will vary more widely.
	  
	- Shady works with Python 2 or 3.
	
	- Recommended third-party packages |numpy|_, |pillow|_, |matplotlib|_,
	  and |ipython|_ are not strictly required, but they improve functionality.
	  By default, they will be installed automatically if you install Shady via
	  `python -m pip install shady`.
	  
	- In addition, |opencv-python|_ allows reading/saving of video files.

Hardware and Operating Systems
------------------------------

Shady was conceived to play a modular role in larger, more complex multi-modal
neuroscience applications. These may include novel human interface devices
and/or specialized neuroscientific equipment, such as eye-trackers and EEG
amplifiers. Manufacturers of such equipment are overwhelmingly more likely
to support Windows than anything else.

Hence, the Windows platform is where we aim to optimize performance, and most
of our experience in doing so has been with Windows 10. On other platforms,
it should not be any harder to get Shady running, but it may be harder to
get it to perform really *well*. Therefore, we had better describe our support
for non-Windows platforms as "experimental". However, our experiences so far
(with macos 10.9 through 10.13, and with Ubuntu 14 in a VirtualBox) indicate
that both the C++ code and CMake files for the :doc:`accelerator <Accelerator>`, and the Python code
of the rest of the module, are cross-platform compatible.

Shady probably will not work on big-endian hardware. Since most commercial CPUs
are little-endian, at least by default, we have had no opportunity to test it
on big-endian systems and little interest in doing so.


Python and Third-Party Python Packages
--------------------------------------

.. _PythonRequirements:

Scientific software packages in Python have an unfortunate tendency to rely on
a "house of cards" made up of specific versions of other third-party
packages. Somewhere in the hierarchy of dependencies, sooner or later you end
up locked into a legacy version of something you don't want. With this in mind,
we limited Shady's dependencies to a small number of well established, very
widely used, and actively developed general-purpose packages. We test it
with 5-year-old versions of its principal dependencies as well as current
versions. We also take care to ensure that Shady's functionality degrades
gracefully even in their absence.

Shady supports Python versions 2 and 3 (specifically CPython, which is the
standard, most prevalent implementation). Shady doesn't have *hard*
dependencies on third-party packages beyond that. On any CPython
implementation of version 2.7.x, or 3.4 and up, some of Shady's core
functionality should be available. This claim comes with two caveats.

The first caveat is that we are assuming availability of the ShaDyLib
:doc:`accelerator <Accelerator>` which is a compiled binary (dynamic library). Compiled
binaries for 32-bit Windows, 64-bit Windows and 64-bit macOS (10.9+) are
bundled as part of the Shady distribution. If you are using a different
OS (e.g. some flavour of Linux, or macOS version earlier than 10.9) or
if the dynamic library fails to load for any reason (some form of
dynamic-library dependency hell, no doubt) then you may need to (re)compile
the accelerator. *Without* the accelerator, you can still run Shady, but
its timing performance will be more inconsistent and generally worse, and
you will need to install another third-party package named `pyglet <https://pypi.org/project/pyglet>`_
for Shady to use as a graphics backend (`python -m pip install pyglet`).

The second caveat is that there are a few *recommended* third-party packages,
without which Shady's functionality is relatively limited. Without any
third-party packages at all, you can display rectangular or oval patches,
with or without a customizable 2-D carrier signal function, a 2-D contrast
modulation function, a spatial windowing function, colour, and dynamic pixel
noise. You will also have :doc:`powerful tools <MakingPropertiesDynamic>`
for governing the way these properties change over time. The following
third-party packages, if available, add specific extra types of
functionality over and above the core:

    |numpy|_:
	
      - Create or render arbitrary textures defined as pixel arrays.
      - Subtle, powerful improvements to existing functionality---for
        example, dynamic objects like `Shady.Dynamics.Integral` can be
        multi-dimensional (see :doc:`examples/dots4.py <examples_dots4>`).

    |pillow|_:

      - Load texture data from common image formats on disk (also
	    requires `numpy`).
      - Render text stimuli, in a mono-spaced font (also requires `numpy`).
      - Save screen capture data to disk in common image formats.

    |matplotlib|_:

      - Render text stimuli in any of the fonts installed on your system
	    (also requires `numpy` and `pillow`).
      - Plot timing diagnostics and image histograms.

    |opencv-python|_:

      - Requires `numpy`.
      - Save stimulus sequences as movie files.
      - Display stimuli from video files or live camera feeds.

    |ipython|_:

      - Improve interactive configuration of Shady stimuli.
      - Improve user experience at the command prompt (e.g. tab completion,
        dynamic object introspection, cross-session command history).

With the exception of `opencv`, these packages are extremely
prevalent, used in every conceivable type of scientific application,
all around the world.  They will get installed by default when you say
`python -m pip install shady` (although, if you have an Anaconda
installation, you may prefer to first ensure they're installed via
`conda` rather than letting |pip|_ do it).  `opencv` is a more
special-purpose package, so we leave it to you to install it if you
want it.

To install everything in a minimal "Miniconda" environment::

	python -m conda install numpy pillow matplotlib ipython
	python -m pip install shady
	python -m conda install opencv

Depending on versions, `opencv` may or may not be available via
`conda`---if not, you can use `pip`.  If your Python distribution
is not Anaconda-flavored, you can let |pip|_ do everything::

	python -m pip install shady
	python -m pip install opencv-python



Known issues
------------

macOS and OpenGL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our random-number generator (for additive noise and for dithering) is of poorer
quality on the Mac.  The reason is as follows: our shader code, written in OpenGL
Shading Language (GLSL) is backwardly compatible with old legacy versions of the
language (GLSL 1.2, corresponding to OpenGL 2.1). However, we use one or two features
from later versions (GLSL 3.3+, corresponding to OpenGL 3.3+) when they are available,
and these features allow us to improve the quality of the random number generator. On
our Windows systems this has worked just fine: legacy GLSL can be mixed with newer
features.  But on macOS this is not allowed: one has to choose either old or new GLSL,
and cannot mix features from one while remaining compatible with the other. For
historical reasons (`pyglet` compatibility, in the absence of our binary accelerator),
we have stuck with the old version.  In future releases we intend to migrate to
modern OpenGL/GLSL, to ensure compatibility with future graphics cards that may drop
legacy GLSL support.
