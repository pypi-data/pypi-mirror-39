Usage
-----

::

    s-tui

or

::

    sudo s-tui

Simple installation
-------------------

pip (x86 + ARM)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most up to date version of s-tui is available with pip

::

    sudo pip install s-tui

Or if you cannot use sudo:

::

    pip install s-tui --user

If you are installing s-tui on a Raspberry-Pi you might need to install
``python-dev`` first

Installation in virtualenv with
`pipsi <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi>`__:

::

    pipsi install s-tui

Options
-------

::

    ********s-tui manual********
    usage: s-tui [-h] [-d] [-c] [-t] [-j] [-nm] [-v] [-ct CUSTOM_TEMP]

    TUI interface:

    The side bar houses the controls for the displayed grahps.
    At the bottom of the side bar, more information is presented in text form.

    * Use the arrow keys or 'hjkl' to navigate the side bar
    * Toggle between stressed and regular operation using the radio buttons in 'Modes'.
    * If you wish to alternate stress defaults, you can do it in 'Stress options'
    * Select a different temperature sensors from the 'Temp Sensors' menu
    * Change time between updates using the 'Refresh' field
    * Use the 'Reset' button to reset graphs and statistics
    * Toggle displayed graphs by selecting the [X] check box
    * If a sensor is not available on your system, N/A is presented
    * If your system supports it, you can use the utf8 button to get a smoother graph
    * Press 'q' or the 'Quit' button to quit

    * Run `s-tui --help` to get this message and additional cli options

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -d, --debug           Output debug log to _s-tui.log
      -c, --csv             Save stats to csv file
      -t, --terminal        Display a single line of stats without tui
      -j, --json            Display a single line of stats in JSON format
      -nm, --no-mouse       Disable Mouse for TTY systems
      -v, --version         Display version
      -ct CUSTOM_TEMP, --custom_temp CUSTOM_TEMP
                            
                            Custom temperature sensors.
                            The format is: <sensors>,<number>
                            As it appears in 'sensors'
                            e.g
                            > sensors
                            it8792-isa-0a60,
                            temp1: +47.0C
                            temp2: +35.0C
                            temp3: +37.0C
                            
                            use: -ct it8792,0 for temp 1
                               
      -cf CUSTOM_FAN, --custom_fan CUSTOM_FAN
                            Similar to custom temp
                            e.g
                            >sensors
                            thinkpad-isa-0000
                            Adapter: ISA adapter
                            fan1:        1975 RPM
                            
                            use: -cf thinkpad,0 for fan1

Dependencies
------------

s-tui is a great tool for monitoring. If you would like to stress your
computer, install stress. Stress options will then show up in s-tui
(optional)

::

    sudo apt-get install stress

Configuration
-------------

s-tui is a self-contained application which can run out-of-the-box and
doesn't need config files to drive its core features. However,
additional features like running scripts when a certain threshold has
been exceeded (e.g. CPU temperature) does necessitate creating a config
directory. This directory will be made in ``~/.config/s-tui`` by
default.

Selecting <Save Settings> will save the current configuration to
``~/.config/s-tui/s-tui.conf``. If you would like to restore defaults,
simply remove the file.

Adding threshold scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

s-tui gives you the ability to run arbitrary shell scripts when a
certain threshold is surpassed, like your CPU temperature. You can
define this custom behaviour by adding a shell file to the directory
``~/.config/s-tui/hooks.d`` with one of the following names, depending
on what threshold you're interesting in reacting to:

-  ``temperaturesource.sh``: triggered when the CPU temperature
   threshold is exceeded

If s-tui finds a script in the hooks directory with the name of a source
it supports, it will run that script every 30 seconds as long as the
current value of the source remains above the threshold.

Note that at the moment only CPU temperature threshold hooks are
supported.

More installation methods
-------------------------

Ubuntu
~~~~~~

| The latest stable version of s-tui is available via pip. To install
  pip on Ubuntu run:
| ``sudo apt-get install gcc python-dev python-pip``
| Once pip is installed, install s-tui from pip:
| ``(sudo) pip install s-tui``

Ubuntu(PPA)
~~~~~~~~~~~

A ppa is available but is not always up to date(xenial,bionic)

::

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:amanusk/python-s-tui
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3-s-tui

Ubuntu(18.10)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    sudo apt install s-tui

Arch-Linux
~~~~~~~~~~

AUR packages of s-tui are available

| ``s-tui`` is the latest stable release version. Maintained by
  [@DonOregano](https://github.com/DonOregano)
| ``s-tui-git`` follows the master branch. maintained by
  [@MauroMombelli](https://github.com/MauroMombelli)
| install with
| ``yay -S s-tui``

Run from source
---------------

| Running s-tui from source
| Clone

::

    git clone https://github.com/amanusk/s-tui.git

Install dependencies, these need to be installed to run
``python -m s_tui.s_tui``

::

    (sudo) pip install urwid
    (sudo) pip install psutil

Install stress (optional)

::

    sudo apt-get install stress

Run the .py file

::

    (sudo) python -m s_tui.s_tui

OPTIONAL integration of FIRESTARTER (via submodule, does not work on all systems)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIRESTARTER is a great tool to stress your system to the extreme. If you
would like, you can integrate FIRESTARTER submodule into s-tui. To build
FIRESTARTER

::

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    cd ./FIRESTARTER
    ./code-generator.py
    make

| Once you have completed these steps, you can either: \* Install
  FIRESTARTER to make it accessible to s-tui, e.g make a soft-link to
  FIRESTARTER in /usr/local/bin. \* Run s-tui from the main project
  directory with ``python -m s_tui.s_tui``
| An option to run FIRESTARTER will then be available in s-tui

Compatibility
-------------

s-tui uses psutil to probe some of your hardware information. If your
hardware is not supported, you might not see all the information.

-  | On Intel machines:
   | Running s-tui as root gives access to the maximum Turbo Boost
     frequency available to your CPU when stressing all cores. Running
     without root will display the Turbo Boost available on a single
     core.

-  Power read is supported on Intel Core CPUs of the second generation
   and newer (Sandy Bridge)
-  s-tui tested to run on Raspberry-Pi 3,2,1

FAQ
---

| **Q**: How is this different from htop?
| **A**: s-tui is not a processes monitor like htop. The purpose is to
  monitor your CPU statistics and have an option to test the system
  under heavy load. (Think AIDA64 stress test, not task manager).

| **Q**: What features require sudo permissions?
| **A**: Top Turbo frequency varies depending on how many cores are
  utilized. Sudo permissions are required in order to accurately read
  the top frequency when all the cores are utilized.

| **Q**: I don't have a temperature graph
| **A**: Systems have different sensors to read CPU temperature. If you
  do not see a temperature read, your system might not be supported
  (yet). You can try manually setting the sensor with the cli interface
  (see --help), or selecting a sensor from the 'Temp Sensors' menu

| **Q**: I have a temperature graph, but it is wrong.
| **A**: A default sensor is selected for temperature reads. On some
  systems this sensor might indicate the wrong temperature. You can
  manually select a sensor from the 'Temp Sensors' menu or using the cli
  interface (see --help)

| **Q**: I am using the TTY with no X server and s-tui crashes on start
| **A**: By default, s-tui is handles mouse inputs. This causes some
  systems to crash. Try running ``s-tui --no-mouse``

| **Q**: I am not seeing all the stats in the sidebar
| **A**: The sidebar is scrollable, you can scroll down with ``DOWN`` or
  ``j`` or scroll to the bottom with ``PG-DN`` or ``G``. You can also
  decrees the font of you terminal, to view more at once.
