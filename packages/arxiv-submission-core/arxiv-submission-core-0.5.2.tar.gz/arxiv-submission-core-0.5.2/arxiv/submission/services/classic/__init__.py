"""
Integration with the classic database to persist events and submission state.

As part of the classic renewal strategy, development of new submission
interfaces must maintain data interoperability with classic components. This
service module must therefore do three main things:

1. Store and provide access to event data generated during the submission
   process,
2. Keep the classic database tables up to date so that "downstream" components
   can continue to operate. Since classic components work directly on
   submission tables, persisting events and resulting submission state must
   occur in the same transaction.
3. Patch NG submission data with state changes that occur in the classic
   system. Those changes will be made directly to submission tables and not
   involve event-generation. See :func:`get_submission` for details.

ORM representations of the classic database tables involved in submission
are located in :mod:`.classic.models`. An additional model, :class:`.DBEvent`,
is defined in :mod:`.classic.event`.
