Description: # BrainOwl
        
        This is a classifier tuned for neuroimaging. In particular for task-related
        fMRI. It is meant to be used with the OWL norm (also called Ordered $l_1$ norm)
        and uses a solver based on SpaRSA.
        
        The OWL norm should identify features relevant for the learning problem, even if
        they are correlated. Weight maps based on OWL tend to be sparse, but not so
        sparse like the solutions from LASSO, for example.
        
        # Install
        
        Install using `pip` (be sure you have python3>=3.5):
        
        ``` {.bash}
        pip install brainowl
        ```
        
        And done.
        
        If you want to have the source code, you can clone the repository using `git`:
        
        ``` {.bash}
        git clone https://github.com/jpvaldes/brainowl.git
        ```
        
        and then install it:
        
        ``` {.bash}
        cd brainowl
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        # Usage example
        
        The included Jupyter notebook contains an example usage of the BrainOwl
        classifier showing how to decode two categories of the classic neuroimaging
        Haxby dataset.
        
        The dataset will be downloaded automatically if it is not found.
