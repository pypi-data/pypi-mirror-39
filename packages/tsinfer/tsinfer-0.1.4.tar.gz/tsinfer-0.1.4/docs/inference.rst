==================
Inference overview
==================

The process of inferring a tree sequence from variation data is split into a
number of different steps. We first review the
:ref:`requirements <sec_inference_data_requirements>` for input data
and discuss how such data is :ref:`imported <sec_inference_import_samples>`
into ``tsinfer``'s sample data format. We then outline the three
basic steps for inference:
:ref:`generating ancestors <sec_inference_generate_ancestors>`,
:ref:`matching ancestors <sec_inference_match_ancestors>` and
:ref:`matching samples <sec_inference_match_samples>`.

.. _sec_inference_data_requirements:

*****************
Data requirements
*****************

Input haplotype data for tskit must satisfy the following requirements:

- Data must be *phased*.
- For each site we must know the *ancestral state*. Note that this is
  not necessarily the same as the REF column from VCF, and ancestral
  states must be computed using some other method.
- Only biallelic sites are currently supported.


.. _sec_inference_data_model:

**********
Data model
**********

The data model for ``tsinfer`` is tightly integrated with
``msprime``'s `data model <https://msprime.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interchange.html>`_
and uses the same concepts throughout. The intermediate file formats and APIs
described here provide a bridge between this model and existing data sources. For
convenience, we provide a brief description of concepts needed for importing
data into ``tsinfer`` here. Please see the `msprime documentation
<https://msprime.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_ for more detailed
information.

.. _sec_inference_data_model_individual:

++++++++++
Individual
++++++++++

In ``tsinfer`` an individual defines one of the subjects for which we have
genotype data. Individuals may have arbitrary ploidy levels (i.e., haploid,
diploid, tetraploid, etc.). Different individuals within a dataset can have
different ploidy levels. Individuals are added using the
:meth:`.SampleData.add_individual` method.

Arbitrary :ref:`sec_inference_data_model_metadata` can be associated with individuals.

.. _sec_inference_data_model_sample:

++++++
Sample
++++++

Each individual is composed of one or more ``samples``, depending on their
ploidy. If an individual is diploid they have two samples, one each for the
maternal and paternal chromosomes copies. More generally, a ``node`` refers
to a maternal or paternal chromosome that is either a sample or an
ancestor of our samples.

When we add an individual with ploidy ``k`` using
:meth:`.SampleData.add_individual`, ``k`` new samples are also added
which refer to this new individual. When adding genotype information using the
:meth:`.SampleData.add_site` method, the user must ensure that the observed
genotypes are in this same order.

.. _sec_inference_data_model_population:

++++++++++
Population
++++++++++

A population is some grouping of individuals. Populations principally
exist to allow us define metadata for groups of individuals (although
technically, population IDs are associated with samples).
Populations are added using the :meth:`.SampleData.add_population`
method.

.. _sec_inference_data_model_metadata:

++++++++
Metadata
++++++++

Metadata can be associated with populations and individuals in ``tsinfer``,
which results in this information being available in the final tree
sequence. Metadata allows us to incorporate extra information
that is not part of the basic data model; for example, we can record
the upstream ID of a given individual and their family relationships
with other individuals.

In ``tsinfer``, metadata can be stored by providing a JSON encodable
mapping. This information is then stored as JSON, and embedded in the
final tree sequence object and can be recovered using the ``msprime``
APIs.

.. _sec_inference_import_samples:

*******************
Import samples data
*******************

In ``tsinfer`` we make several passes through the input sample haplotypes
in order to construct ancestors and to find copying paths for samples. To
do this efficiently we store the data using the `zarr library
<http://zarr.readthedocs.io>`_, which provides very fast access to
large arrays of numerical data compressed using cutting-edge
`compression methods <http://numcodecs.readthedocs.io>`_. As a result, we
can store the input sample haplotypes and related metadata in a
fraction of the size of a compressed VCF as well as process it efficiently.

Rather than require the user to understand the internal structure of this
file format, we provide a simple :ref:`Python API <sec_api_file_formats>`
to allow the user to efficiently construct it from their own data.
An example of how to use this API is given in the :ref:`sec_tutorial`.

We do not provide an automatic means of importing data from VCF (or any
other format) intentionally, as we believe that this would be extremely difficult to do.
As there is no universally accepted way of encoding ancestral state
information in VCF, in practise the user would most often have to write
a new VCF file with ancestral state and metadata information in a specific
form that we would require. Thus, it is more efficient to skip this intermediate
step and to directly produce a :ref:`format <sec_file_formats_samples>`
that is both compact and very efficient to process.

.. _sec_inference_generate_ancestors:

******************
Generate ancestors
******************

The first step in a ``tsinfer`` inference process is to generate a large
number of potential ancestors and to store these in an
:ref:`ancestors file <sec_file_formats_ancestors>`. The ancestors
file conventionally ends with ``.ancestors``.

.. todo:: Describe the ancestor generation algorithm.


.. _sec_inference_match_ancestors:

***************
Match ancestors
***************

After we have generated a set of potential ancestors and stored them in
and :ref:`ancestors file <sec_file_formats_ancestors>`, we then
run a matching process on these ancestors. Each ancestor occurs at a
given time, and an ancestor can copy from any older ancestor. For each
ancestor, we find a path through older ancestors that minimises the
number of recombination events.

.. todo:: Schematic of the ancestors copying process.

The copying path for each ancestor then describes its ancestry at every
point in the sequence: from a genealogical perspective, we know its
parent node. This information is encoded precisely as an `edge
<http://msprime.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interchange.html#edge-table>`_ in a
`tree sequence <http://msprime.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interchange.html#data-model>`_.
Thus, we refer to the output of this step as the "ancestors tree sequence",
which is conventionally stored in a file ending with ``.ancestors.trees``.

.. _sec_inference_match_samples:

*************
Match samples
*************

The final phase of a ``tsinfer`` inference consists of a number steps:

1. The first (and usually most time-consuming) is to find copying paths
   for our sample haplotypes through the ancestors. Each copying path
   corresponds to a set of tree sequence edges in precisely the same
   way as for ancestors.

2. As we only use a subset of the available sites for inference
   (excluding by default any sites that are fixed or singletons)
   we then place mutations on the inferred trees in order to
   represent the information at these sites. We currently use a
   form of Dollo parsimony to do this. For a given site with
   a set of samples with the derived state, first find the MRCA
   of these samples, and place a mutation at this node. Then,
   for all samples in this subtree that carry the ancestral
   state, place a back mutation to the ancestral state directly over
   this sample. **Note this approach is suboptimal because there
   may be clades of ancestral state samples which would allow us
   to encode the data with fewer back mutations.**

3. Reduce the resulting tree sequence to a canonical form by
   `simplifying it
   <http://msprime.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#msprime.TreeSequence.simplify>`_.

.. todo::
    1. Describe path compression here and above in the ancestors
       section
    2. Describe the structure of the outpt tree sequences; how the
       nodes are mapped, what the time values mean, etc.
