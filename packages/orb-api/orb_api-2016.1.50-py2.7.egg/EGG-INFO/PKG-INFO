        for databases.
        
        Installation
        -----------------------
        
        If you would like to use the latest build that has been tested and published,
        you can use the Python `setuptools` to install it to your computer or virtual
        environment:
        
            pip install orb-api
        
        If you would like to use the latest code base, you can clone the repository
        and reference and run `setup.py` for your virtual environment
        
            git clone https://github.com/orb-framework/orb.git
            cd orb
            python setup.py develop
        
        Running Tests
        -----------------------
        
        To run the unit tests, you can just run the test command from the setuptools
        
            python setup.py test
        
        To run the functional tests, you will need to specify the test environment using the
        [tox](https://testrun.org/tox/latest/) command line utility.
        
            pip install tox
            tox -e postgres
