## QUICK SETUP: Simply search and update the SCRAPYD_SERVERS item, leave the rest as default.

## 快速设置：搜索并更新 SCRAPYD_SERVERS 配置项即可，其余配置项保留默认值。

############################## Scrapyd #################################
# Make sure that [Scrapyd](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapyd) has been installed and started on all of your hosts.
# Note that if you want to visit Scrapyd remotely,
# you have to manually set the [bind_address](https://scrapyd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#bind-address)
# to 'bind_address = 0.0.0.0' and restart Scrapyd to make it visible externally.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 请先确保所有主机都已经安装和启动 [Scrapyd](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapyd) ，
# 如需远程访问 Scrapyd，则需将 Scrapyd 配置文件中的 [bind_address](https://scrapyd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#bind-address)
# 修改为 'bind_address = 0.0.0.0'，然后重启 Scrapyd。

# Support multiple Scrapyd servers:
# - string format: username:password@ip:port#group
#   - default port would be 6800 if not provided,
#   - basic auth and group info are both optional.
#   - e.g., '127.0.0.1' or 'username:password@192.168.123.123:6801#group'
# - tuple format: (username, password, ip, port, group)
#   - When username or password or group info is too complicated (e.g., contains ':@#'),
#   - or if ScrapydWeb fails to parse the string format passed in,
#   - it's recommended to pass in a tuple with 5 elements
#   - e.g., ('', '', '127.0.0.1', '', '') or ('username', 'password', '192.168.123.123', '6801', 'group')

# Set to speed up loading scrapy logs.
# e.g., 'C:/Users/username/logs/' or '/home/username/logs/'
# The setting takes effect only when both ScrapydWeb and Scrapyd run on the same host,

############################## Email Notice ############################
# Keep in mind that "Email Notice" depends on "HTML Caching" to collect statistics,
# so you have to enable "HTML Caching" by setting "ENABLE_CACHE = True"
# before setting "ENABLE_EMAIL = True" (check out the "HTML Caching" section above).

# In order to be notified (and stop/forcestop a job when triggered) in time,
# you can reduce the value of CACHE_ROUND_INTERVAL (and CACHE_REQUEST_INTERVAL),
# at the cost of burdening both CPU and bandwidth of your servers.

# Tip: set SCRAPYDWEB_BIND to the actual IP of  your server, then you can visit ScrapydWeb via the links in the email.
# (check out the "ScrapydWeb" section above)
