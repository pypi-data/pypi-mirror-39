# INDI Web Manager

INDI Web Manager is a simple Web Application to manage
[INDI](http://www.indilib.org) server. It supports multiple driver profiles
along with optional custom remote drivers. It can be used to start INDI server
locally, and also to connect or **chain** to remote INDI servers.

The Web Application is based on [Bottle Py](http://bottlepy.org)
micro-framework. It has a built-in webserver and by default listens on port
8624.

# Installation

Before installing the **indiweb** package, make sure the INDI library is
installed on the target system.

You can install the **indiweb** Python package using pip:

```
$ pip install indiweb
```

You may want to install it system-wide, only in your user account or even into
a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) (if you are a
developer).

If you want to install it system-wide, you will have to invoke pip with
superuser rights:

```
$ sudo pip install indiweb
```

# Usage

After installing the **indiweb** package, the command **indi-web** will be
available in your sytem PATH.

You can obtain help about the **indi-web** command by invoking:

```
$ indi-web -h
```

The INDI Web Manager runs as a standalone web server. It can be started
manually by invoking:

```
$ indi-web -v
```

Then using your favorite web browser, go to
[http://localhost:8624](http://localhost:8624) if the INDI Web Manager is
running locally. If the INDI Web Manager is installed on a remote system,
simply replace localhost with the hostname or IP address of the remote system.

# Auto start

If you selected any profile as **Auto Start** then the INDI server shall be
automatically started when the service is executed at start up.

# Systemd configuration

The provided file `indiwebmanager.service` is an example *systemd service file*
that can be used to run `indi-web` as *pi* user. If your username is different
please edit the file and change the username first.

Copy your preferred service file to `/etc/systemd/system`:

```
sudo cp indiwebmanager.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/indiwebmanager.service
```

Now configure systemd to load the service file during boot:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable indiwebmanager.service
```

Finally, reboot the system for your changes to take effect:

```
sudo reboot
```

After startup, check the status of the INDI Web Manager service:

```
sudo systemctl status indiwebmanager.service
```

If all appears OK, you can start using the Web Application using any browser.

# Profiles

The Web Application provides a default profile to run simulator drivers. To use
a new profile, add the profile name and then click  the plus button. Next,
select which drivers to run under this particular profile. After selecting the
drivers, click the **Save** icon to save all your changes. To enable automatic
startup of INDI server for a particular profile when the device boots up or
when invoked manually via the **systemctl** command, check the **Auto Start**
checkbox.

# API

INDI Web Manager provides a RESTful API to control all aspects of the
application. Data communication is via JSON messages. All URLs are appended to
the hostname:port running the INDI Web Manager.
