Description: # storm-indicator-pyqt
        
        PyQt based indicator for connecting to your SSH hosts easily.
        
        **storm-indicator-pyqt** uses [~/.ssh/config](http://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config) files to list SSH connections. If you don't use your SSH config file yet,  you can optionally use [storm](http://www.github.com/emre/storm)
        to easily add your servers.
        Based on [emre/storm-indicator](https://github.com/emre/storm-indicator)
